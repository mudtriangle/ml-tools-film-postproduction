Blue sky, fluffy clouds.
The TOY STORY logo.  A branding iron sears a “3” into it.  
IMAGE bursts into FLAMES...

EXT. OLD WEST - DAY
A train races across the desert. MOVE IN on an ARMORED CAR. 
Suddenly, the roof blows open.

EXT. TRAIN - DAY
Money bags fly out.  ONE-EYED BART (Mr. Potato Head) follows.

Money, money, money!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha! 

ONE-EYED BART

Bart stashes the loot.  Suddenly, a lasso yanks his arm off. 

Hey!

ONE-EYED BART

The lasso lifts him off his feet.  He falls, dazed.  A 
figure approaches -- WOODY.  He pins Bart with his boot.

WOODY

You got a date with justice, One-Eyed 
Bart!

Too bad, Sheriff -- I’m a married man.

ONE-EYED BART

A WAR CRY.  Woody looks up.

VOICE (O.S.)
Ai!  Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-yah!

A Ninja warrior, ONE-EYED BETTY (Mrs. Potato Head), flips 
down the train roof, wielding a sword and nun-chucks.  

One-Eyed Betty!

WOODY

Woody handsprings away.  He gets to the end of the Caboose.  
Betty hits him with her purse.  He teeters, then falls.

Whoa, whoa...  Ahhh...!

WOODY

Bart and Betty laugh, peek over the edge...

GALLOPING HOOVES
TILT UP to find Woody, riding BULLSEYE, JESSIE at the reins.

              2

JESSIE

I believe you dropped something, 
Mister!

Jessie?!

ONE-EYED BART 

WOODY

You’ve reached the end of the line, 
Bart.

Bart pulls out a remote detonator.

ONE-EYED BART

I always wanted to go out with a 
bang!

Ahead, a huge trestle bridge spans a canyon.  ZOOM to 
REVEAL -- The middle of the bridge is loaded with dynamite.  
Bart laughs, hits the detonator.  The bridge explodes.
Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye gasp.

Oh no! 

The orphans!

JESSIE

WOODY

WHIP PAN -- A train car of TROLLS lean out the windows.
One-Eyed Bart cackles.

ONE-EYED BART

Hate to leave early, but our ride is 
here.

HONK-HONK!  A pink Corvette, driven by the three ALIENS, 
pulls up alongside the train.

Oooooooooo!

ALIENS

ONE-EYED BART

It’s me or the kiddies, Sheriff!  
Take your pick!

The Potato Heads leap off the train into the Corvette.  
They speed off.  Woody looks at the out-of-control train. 

              3

Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

WOODY

Bullseye runs up next to the speeding locomotive. 

WOODY
Hold him steady...

Woody stands, then leaps from Bullseye into the locomotive.  

Woody, hurry!

JESSIE

Woody turns a gear, pulls the brake.
Train wheels lock.  Sparks fly.  Woody looks ahead.
POV -- The train skids toward the severed rails.
Bullseye and Jessie skid to a stop at the canyon edge.
Too late.  Woody and the train plummet over the edge.  
Bullseye and Jessie are horrified.

No...!

JESSIE

From deep in the canyon, a FLASH and RUMBLE.  
Then, the entire train rises into the sky.  
Holding it from below is BUZZ LIGHTYEAR.  

Glad I could catch the train!

BUZZ

Woody leans out the front.

Now let’s catch some criminals! 

WOODY

To Infinity...  And Beyond!

BUZZ

EXT. DESERT PLAINS
A large, hand-painted sign reads:
                    Border Crossing
                       One Mile
                    Outlaws Welcome

CUT TO:

              4

WHIP PAN -- The Corvette speeds past.  
The Outlaws laugh gleefully.  Bart kisses his loot.  
The Aliens see something in the sky, point...

OooOOOOoooo!

ALIENS

Buzz flies out of the sun, firing his laser.
The Corvette is sliced in half.  The halves fall away.
The Outlaws tumble into a heap.
Woody and Jessie step up.  Buzz lands nearby, laser poised.

WOODY
Reach for the sky!

ONE-EYED BART

You can’t touch me, Sheriff!  I 
brought my attack dog with a 
built-in force field!

Bart WHISTLES.  
From above, SLINKY springs down the canyon walls, coils 
crackling with energy.  He circles the gang, bites his 
tail.  An ENERGY BUBBLE forms around them. 

WOODY
Well, I brought my dinosaur, who eats 
force-field dogs!

Yo-Dee-Le-Hi-HoooOOOOOOOO!

JESSIE

The Earth trembles.  Cracks form.  The ground bursts open.  
A giant REX emerges, BELLOWING.
He leans toward Bart, lets out a fearsome ROAR.  
A shadow.  Rex stops.  An intense HUM.  Everyone looks up.  
An enormous, pig-shaped spaceship hovers above them.

Evil Dr. Porkchop!!!

BUZZ

We FLY UP to...

              5

INT. SPACESHIP - DAY
DR. PORKCHOP (Hamm) sits on the bridge, sporting a bowler. 

That’s Mr. Evil Dr. Porkchop to you!

EVIL DR. PORKCHOP

Bart, Betty, Slinky, and the Aliens are suddenly beamed up.  
Hamm flips open a switch.  A red button: DEATH BY MONKEYS.
He pushes it.  
The ship’s belly swings open.  A yellow barrel is dropped.  
The barrel falls.  
It explodes into a mushroom cloud of crazed red monkeys.
Woody, Buzz and Jessie flee.  The Monkeys come after them.
Rex ROARS.  The Monkeys swarm over him, taking him down.
Woody, Buzz and Jessie are overtaken and pinned down.
The spaceship’s snout rotates and opens.  A giant laser 
cannon powers up with a deafening HUM.  Bart LAUGHS and 
reaches for a button marked with a skull and crossbones...
Jessie turns away, eyes shut.  
Bart LAUGHS louder.  
Buzz turns away.  
Bart CACKLES -- finger on the trigger.
Woody grimaces...

CUT TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY
Andy imitates One-Eyed Bart’s LAUGH.
On Woody and Buzz.  Andy’s hands move Woody as he “talks”.

YOUNG ANDY (AS WOODY)
Buzz! Shoot your laser at my badge!

Woody, no! It’ll kill you!

YOUNG ANDY (AS BUZZ)

Just do it!

YOUNG ANDY (AS WOODY)

              6

Andy presses Buzz’s laser, makes a ricochet sound -- PSHOO! 
-- off Woody’s badge and traces a line into the air...
...Where Hamm, the Potato Heads and the Aliens perch on a 
winged cardboard box, crudely fashioned into a spaceship, 
that dangles from the ceiling.  
Andy hits the carton -- PPPKOOOOOSHHH!!!  
The Toys tumble to pillows on the floor. 

CUT TO:

CAMCORDER POV - HANDHELD 
MOM’S hand pushes open a door.  Andy, 8, in his cowboy hat, 
jumps around making EXPLOSION NOISES.  
He’s turned his room into a Western “set” complete with a 
Tinkertoy trestle bridge, a Barrel of Monkeys, etc.

YOUNG ANDY 

(as Woody)

You’re going to jail, Bart. 
Camera ZOOMS IN.  Andy looks up, stops.

Mom...!?

YOUNG ANDY

MOM (O.C.)

No, no...!  Keep playing!  Just 
pretend I’m not here.

Suddenly, MOLLY, 2, toddles in, knocking over Tinker Toys.

Oh, no!  Molly...!

MOM (O.C.)

YOUNG ANDY

No, it’s okay, Mom!  It’s...  A 50-
foot baby from outer space!  She’s 
on a rampage!  Run for your lives!

Andy races around.  Chaos, laughing.  Buster enters, BARKING.  
The CAMERA PIVOTS UPSIDE-DOWN, revealing Mom’s face.

Does the red light mean it’s going?

MOM

The TAPE GLITCHES and we JUMP TO... 
BEGIN MUSIC -- “You’ve Got A Friend In Me”

              7

INT. ANDY’S KITCHEN - DAY - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV
Molly sits in a high chair, party hat on, eating cake.  
Camera PANS Andy’s Toys, wearing party hats.  End on Andy, 
holding Woody, stuffing cake in his mouth.

MOM (O.C.)

Come on, say ‘Happy Birthday’ to 
Molly...

YOUNG ANDY

Happhy Brffday!

Oh, charming.

JUMP TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - NIGHT - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV
Andy lies in a pillow fort, surrounded by toys, eating from 
a huge bowl of popcorn, and watching an off-screen TV.  
He stuffs popcorn in Rex’s mouth, turns back to the TV.  
His eyes widen.  The popcorn tumbles out of Rex’s mouth.

Andy, laughing, spins around, falls on his bed, pulls his 
toys close -- holding Woody, Buzz and Jessie in the warm, 
glowing embrace of a child’s innocent and boundless love.  
The song FADES on “Our friendship will never die...” 

FADE TO BLACK

WOODY (V.O.)

Okay -- places, everyone!  C’mon, 
get in position!

INT. TOY CHEST, ANDY’S ROOM - DAY
Dark, crowded.  Toys crammed together.  Light seeps in.  
Nervous, backstage jitters.  They speak in HUSHED TONES.

Wait -- I can’t find my other eye!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

              9

Someone’s foot is in my face...

HAMM

It’s mine!  Give it back!

MR. POTATO HEAD

ALIENS
You saved our lives!  We are 
eternally grateful!

Potato Head groans. Buzz sits by the rim. Jessie climbs up.

JESSIE

Buzz, mind if I squeeze in next to 
ya?!

BUZZ

Yes!  No!  I mean...!  Why would I 
mind?!  Squeezing next to...  You!  

He laughs, nervous.  She grins.  Finally, he turns away. 

Is it hot in here?

BUZZ (CONT'D)

Here they come!

REX (O.S.)

The Toys clamber to the rim and gaze out.
POV -- SARGE and two ARMY MEN slip in the room, dragging 
something in a gym sock.  
The Army Men arrive at the chest.  Woody peers down.

Sarge!  You got it...?!

WOODY 

Mission accomplished!

SARGE

The Toys are thrilled.  The Army Men hoist the sock up.

Careful...!  Careful!!!

WOODY

Buzz turns the sock upside-down.  A cell phone slides out.  
Toys gather around.

WOODY (CONT'D)

All right, guys.  We got one shot at 
this.  Everyone ready?

We’re ready, Woody!  Let’s do it! 

JESSIE

              10

Buzz -- make the call.

WOODY

Buzz flips open his wrist cover.  A phone number is written 
inside.  Jessie pulls out a cordless phone, leans close to 
Buzz.  Buzz chuckles, nervous.  Jessie dials the phone.  
Woody tosses the cell phone to Rex. 
Jessie gets to the last digit, hits it.  Silence.  
Suddenly, the cell phone RINGS.  Rex yelps.  
Buzz, Jessie and Woody peer over the rim.  FOOTSTEPS on the 
stairs.

Target is on approach.

BUZZ

Woody’s eyes are fixed on the door.

Just like we rehearsed it, guys...  

WOODY 

The door opens.  ANDY enters but we only SEE his jean-clad 
legs.  He scans the room, zeroes in on the toy chest.  
He lifts the lid REVEALING... 
Andy is a teenager.  His hair is long and his voice deep, 
but he has the same kind face.  He looks down, puzzled.  
The Toys lie, lifeless, amid sports equipment and clothing.  
The phone RINGS again.  Andy’s hand rummages.  
Woody hugs the cordless as Andy’s fingers pass by and find 
the cell phone.
He pulls it out.  The phone is stuck in Rex’s arms.  Andy 
pulls.  Rex clings.  Andy finally yanks the phone loose.

Hello...?

ANDY 

CLOSE ON -- Woody, holding the phone.  He closes his eyes. 

Hello...?! Anyone there?

ANDY (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

Andy hangs up, turns.

ANDY (CONT'D)
Molly, stay outta my room!

              11

I wasn’t in your room!

MOLLY (O.S.)

Andy scoffs, looks down at Rex in his hand.  Rex lies 
frozen, smiling -- eager to be played with.  
Andy drops Rex in the box, shuts the lid, heads out.

Then who was messing with my stuff?

ANDY 

It wasn’t me...!

MOLLY (O.S.)

He departs, closing the door -- CLICK.  
CREAK -- Woody and Buzz push the chest open, share a look.  
The other Toys climb out.

Well, that went well! 

MR. POTATO HEAD

They spill out onto the floor.  The room has changed -- 
rock posters, guitar, skateboard, other teen detritus.  

He held me!  He actually held me!  

REX

Oh, this is just sad.

HAMM

MR. POTATO HEAD 

Who are we kiddin’?  The kid’s 
seventeen years old!

Woody and Buzz jump down, exchange a glance.  Buzz nods.  
Woody waves his arms.

WOODY 

Guys, hey, hold up!  We need a staff 
meeting!  Everyone?  A staff meeting!

GROANS of boredom.

Not again...!

HAMM

WOODY 

Oh, come on!  Slink?  Gather everyone 
up!

Uh...  We are gathered, Woody!

SLINKY

The Toy Community is a lot smaller.  Woody rolls with it.

              12

WOODY

Okay.  First off -- we all knew 
Operation Playtime was a long shot...

More like a misfire! 

MR. POTATO HEAD

WOODY

...But we’ve always said this job 
isn’t about getting played with.  
It’s about...

...Being there for Andy.  We know.

JESSIE

But we can try again, right?

REX

Woody looks at all of them.  He shakes his head.

WOODY

I’m callin’ it, guys.  We’re closin’ 
up shop.  

Gasps.  Everyone is crushed by this news. 

WOODY (CONT'D)

Andy’s going to college any day 
now...  That was our last shot.

Mrs. Potato Head begins to sniffle.  Buzz steps forward.

BUZZ

We’re going into Attic Mode, folks.  
Keep your accessories with you at all 
times -- spare parts, batteries...  
Anything you need for an orderly 
transition.

Potato Head steps up.

MR. POTATO HEAD

“Orderly?”  Don’t you get it?!  We’re 
done!  Finished!  Over the hill!

WOODY

Hey, hey, now come on, guys!  We all 
knew this day was coming!

Buzz, in FOREGROUND, sees something off-screen, frowns.  
POV -- Sarge and the Army Men climb up onto Andy’s desk.  
The other Toys keep arguing.

              13

HAMM (O.C.)
Yeah, but now its here!

WOODY (O.C.)

Look, every toy goes through this!  
No one wants to see their kid leave! 

Hey!  Sarge!  What are you doing?!

BUZZ

Everyone turns.  Sarge and his last two Soldiers climb to 
the window sill.

SARGE

War’s over, folks.  Me ‘n the boys 
are movin’ on.

WOODY

Moving on...?!  
BUZZ

You’re going AWOL?!
SARGE

We done our duty.  Andy’s grown up.

SOLDIER ONE

And let’s face it -- when the trash 
bags come out, we Army guys are the 
first to go.

BUZZ
Trash bags...?!  
WOODY

Who said anything about trash bags?

SARGE

It has been an honor serving with 
you.  Good luck, folks.

Sarge straps in tandem with Soldier One.  They leap.  Their 
parachute opens and the wind carries them off. 

SOLDIER TWO
You’re gonna need it...!

He jumps and flies off too.  The Toys are stunned.

No, no... Wait...!  Wait!  Wait!!!

WOODY

We’re getting thrown away?!

REX

              14

No!  No one’s getting thrown away!

WOODY

How do you know?!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Jessie begins to panic. 

We’re being abandoned...!

JESSIE

We’ll be fine, Jessie!

BUZZ

So why did Sarge leave?!

HAMM

Should we leave?!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

I thought we were goin’ to the attic!

SLINKY

Oh, I hate all this uncertainty...!

REX

Woody turns, waves his arms.

WOODY 

Whoa, whoa!  Hold on!  Quiet!!!
No one’s getting thrown out, okay?!  
We’re all still here, aren’t we?!
I mean, yeah, we’ve lost friends 
along the way -- Wheezy and Etch 
and...

(beat)

Bo Peep...?

REX

Woody nods, stoic.

WOODY

Even...  Even Bo.  All good toys 
who’ve gone on to new owners.  But 
through every yard sale, every spring 
cleaning, Andy held on to us.  He must 
care about us or we wouldn’t be here.  
You wait -- Andy’s gonna tuck us in 
the attic.  It’ll be safe and warm...

...And we’ll all be together.  

BUZZ

              15

WOODY

Exactly.  There’s games up there, and 
books...  And, and...

The race-car track...

BUZZ

The race-car track.  Thank you!

WOODY

SLINKY
And the old TV...!
WOODY

There you go -- the old TV!  And 
those guys from the Christmas 
decorations box!  They’re fun, right?

The Toys shrug, MURMUR in semi-agreement.  Woody softens.

WOODY (CONT'D)
And someday -- if we’re lucky -- Andy 
may have kids of his own...

And he’ll play with us then, right?

REX

Woody looks at Rex, unable to say “yes”.

We’ll always be there for him.

WOODY

BUZZ

Come on, guys!  Let’s get our parts 
together, get ready, and go out on a 
high note.

The Toys disperse.

I’d better find my other eye...

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Where’d ya leave it this time?
She puts a hand over her empty eye socket.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Someplace dark.  And dusty!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Hamm turns to Rex.

HAMM

C’mon.  Let’s see how much we’re 
goin’ for on eBay...

              16

Woody watches as the Toys trudge off. 

WOODY

Don’t worry.  Andy’s gonna take care 
of us.  I guarantee it.

ON THE DRESSER 
Woody climbs up, surveys the room -- posters, guitar, 
textbooks.  He turns to a cork board where Andy’s high 
school graduation photo is pinned.  He lifts it to find...
A SNAPSHOT shows an eight-year-old Andy wearing a cowboy 
hat and posing with Woody and Buzz and all of Andy’s toys.
Woody gazes at the halcyon past he can never return to.  
Buzz steps up behind him.

You guarantee it, huh...?

BUZZ

I dunno, Buzz.  What else could I say?

WOODY

BUZZ 

Whatever happens, at least we’ll be 
together.

CLOSE ON -- The SNAPSHOT of young Andy. 

WOODY (O.C.)
For Infinity and Beyond...

FOOTSTEPS on the stairs.  Woody and Buzz turn.

MOLLY (O.S.)

Can I have your stereo?
ANDY (O.S.)

No!

Why not?

MOLLY (O.S.)

‘Cause I’m taking it with me!

ANDY (O.S.)

The Toys scramble back into the toy chest.  Andy enters 
with Molly close behind.

Can I have your computer?

MOLLY

              17

No!

ANDY

MOLLY
Your video games?
ANDY
Forget it, Molly!

Molly sighs, walks off.  Andy starts typing on his laptop.  
Andy’s Mom enters carrying cardboard boxes and trash bags.

MOM

Okay, Andy, let’s get to work here.  
Anything you’re not taking to college 
either goes in the attic, or it’s 
trash.

She picks up a box and writes “College” in magic marker.  
Andy stares at his computer.
ANDY

Mom, I’m not leaving ‘til Friday!

C’mon -- it’s garbage day.

MOM

Mom...!

ANDY

She picks up his skateboard, puts it in the “College” box.

MOM

Look, it’s simple: Skateboard?  
College.  Little league trophy?  
Probably attic.  Apple core?  Trash.  
You can do the rest.

She tosses an apple core in a trash bag, hands it to Andy.  
Molly opens the Toy Chest.

Why do you still have these Toys?

MOLLY

Molly, out of my room...!

ANDY

Three more days and it’s mine...!

MOLLY 

She strides out the door. 

Molly, you’re not off the hook either!

MOM 

THE TOY CHEST 
The Toys watch as Mom picks up a box, enters Molly’s room.

              18

MOM (CONT'D)

You have more toys than you know what 
to do with.  Some of ‘em could make 
other kids really happy...

What kids...?

MOLLY

MOM

The children at the day care.  
They’re always asking for donations.

Rex whispers.

REX

What’s “day care”?
WOODY

Shhh...!!!

Mom writes SUNNYSIDE on the box.  Molly pouts.

But, Mom...

MOLLY 

MOM

No “buts”.  You choose the toys you 
wanna donate.  I’ll drop ‘em off at 
Sunnyside.

Mom leaves.  Molly sighs -- Moms! -- surveys the room.  She 
picks up a xylophone, a Magic 8-Ball, puts them in the box. 
She picks up her old Barbie. 
MOLLY POV -- Barbie smiles, desperately eager to please.
Molly, indifferent, tosses Barbie into the box, then buries 
her face in a “Teen” magazine. 
THE TOY CHEST
Across the hall, the Toys react.

Poor Barbie...!

JESSIE

I get the Corvette.

HAMM

              19

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY
Mom walks back and finds Andy still on his laptop.

MOM
Andy, come on -- you need to start 
making decisions.
ANDY

Like what?

She pulls open the toy chest.
MOM 

Like, what are you gonna do with 
these toys?  Should we donate ‘em to 
Sunnyside?

No...!

ANDY

Maybe sell them online...?

MOM

ANDY 

Mom -- no one’s gonna want those old 
toys.  They’re junk!

THE TOYS
Silently hear this bombshell.  Mom lowers the lid.

MOM

Fine.  You have ‘til Friday -- 
anything that’s not packed for 
college, or in the attic, is getting 
thrown out.

“Whatever you say, Mom.”

ANDY

He stares at his laptop.  She shakes her head, exits. 
Andy sighs, closes his laptop.  He turns, surveys his room.
He rolls his chair to the toy chest and opens the lid.
Inside are the Toys -- his old friends.  They lie frozen, 
smiling, forever eager to play.  
Andy gazes at them, making a decision.
Abruptly, he grabs a trash bag, snaps it open.  He picks up 
the Toys -- Rex, Potato Head, Jessie -- tosses them in.  

              20

He pulls Hamm’s cork, empties the change out, and dumps 
him, with rest of the Toys, in the trash bag.  
Then Andy picks up Buzz and Woody, looks at them.
POV -- Buzz, grinning and heroic.  Woody, smiling and loyal.
TOYS POV -- Andy turns, tosses Woody in the College box.
The Toys gasp.  Andy drops Buzz into the garbage bag. 
IN THE BAG
Buzz is stunned and hurt.
Andy cinches the bag closed and carries it from the room.  
Behind him, Woody pops up from the College box, shocked.
IN THE BAG
It’s dim and crowded.  

What’s happening...?!!!

REX

MR. POTATO HEAD

We’re getting thrown out, you idiot!  
That’s what’s happening!!!

Woody jumps from the box, runs across the room, hides 
behind the door frame.
Andy walks onto the hall landing, reaches up, and pulls 
open a trapdoor ladder that leads to the attic.
Woody watches, relieved.
Andy begins climbing to the attic.  One rung...  Two...  
Molly enters the hall landing, struggling with her box.   
It hits the door frame.  A Magic 8-Ball falls out.

ANDY
You need a hand? 
MOLLY

I got it...

Andy steps down, leaves the bag at the foot of the ladder, 
grabs the 8-Ball.  He helps Molly carry her box downstairs.

ANDY

Here.  So, you gonna miss me when I’m 
gone?

              21

MOLLY 

If I say ‘no’, do I still get your 
room?

Nope.

ANDY

Then, yes, I’ll miss you.

MOLLY 

They disappear.
IN THE BAG
The Toys are piled all over each other.  Jessie is hyper-
ventilating.  Buzz looks around -- plotting his next move.

JESSIE

I can’t breathe!
REX

This can’t be happening!!!

Quiet...!!!!  What’s that sound?

BUZZ

They all listen.  A faint CREAKING.
ON THE LANDING
The attic ladder -- spring loaded -- retracts, pushing the 
toy-filled trash bag out of the way.
IN THE BAG
The bag is tipped over.  The Toys tumble over each other.

Whooaaaaa...!!!

TOYS

ON THE LANDING
The ladder pushes free and rises to the ceiling, retracting 
completely.  Woody tiptoes into the hall toward the bag.
Suddenly, Mom enters carrying a trash bag.  Woody retreats.  
Mom trips over the toy-filled bag, looks down -- irritated.

Andy...?!

MOM

No answer.  Mom sighs, picks up the toy-filled bag and 
exits, carrying it downstairs.

              22

ANDY’S ROOM
Woody -- at the door -- is electrified.

That’s not trash!  That’s not trash!!

WOODY

He steps back, mind reeling.

WOODY (CONT'D)

Think, Woody...!  Think!  Think!
Oooh! 
Buster!  C’mere, boy! C’mere!

(an idea)
(whistles)

Off-screen PAWS and the JINGLE of a dog collar.  Buster 
enters -- old, saggy, panting.  Woody vaults onto his back.

Okay, boy!  To the curb!  Hyah!!!

WOODY (CONT'D)

Buster yawns and flops over, pinning Woody under him.  

No, Buster, no...!  

WOODY (CONT'D)

Woody grabs Buster by the jowls, pulls him backwards.  
Finally, Buster rolls over.  Woody sits up, gasping.
Off-screen, a door SLAMS.  Woody turns.
Woody rushes to the window, gazes out.  
POV -- Mom drops the trash bags at the curb.  
WHIP PAN -- Rumbling up the street is a garbage truck. 
Woody gasps.
IN THE BAG
Mounting panic.  

JESSIE
We’re on the curb!  

Oh, I knew it would come to this!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Buzz grabs the side of the bag, tries to tear it open.  

Pull, everyone!  Pull!!!

BUZZ

              23

EXT. ANDY’S HOUSE - DAY
Woody grabs a pair of scissors, shoves them in his holster.  
He lunges for the drainpipe, slides down, hits a gutter and 
tumbles into the bushes below.  CRASH!
IN THE BAG
The Toys follow Buzz’s lead, pulling the sides of the bag.  

It won’t rip!

REX

HAMM

Ah, forget it!  It’s triple-ply high-
density polyethylene!

BUZZ 

There’s gotta be a way out!  
MR. POTATO HEAD 

Andy doesn’t want us!  What’s the 
point?

BUZZ
(thinking)

Point...  Point...  POINT!!!

Buzz looks at Rex’s pointy tail.
OUTSIDE THE BAG
The truck RUMBLES closer, two driveways away.
IN THE BAG
The Toys follow Buzz, shoving Rex backwards.

BUZZ (CONT'D)

Push!  Push!!! 
REX

I can hear the garbage truck!

OUTSIDE THE BAG
The bag stretches.  Rex’s tail is nearly through.
IN THE BAG

It’s getting closer-fffmmm!

REX (CONT'D)

Rex is muffled by a mouthful of plastic.

              24

IN THE YARD
Woody uses the scissors to snip his way out of the bush.  
The garbage truck approaches Andy’s driveway.  
Woody races out, dives behind the mail box post.  The 
GARBAGE MAN is in head phones, playing air guitar, drumming 
the mail box.  He empties a garbage can into the truck.
Woody ducks from behind the post, plunges his scissors into 
a garbage bag.  
Garbage spills out: wrong bag.  He tries another.  No luck.
As the Garbage Man turns, Woody ducks behind the post.  The 
Garbage Man grabs the last bags, tosses them in the truck.
He climbs on a running board, SLAPS the side.  
The truck shifts into gear and lurches off down the street.
THE STREET
As the truck rumbles off, Woody ducks from behind the mail 
box, runs after it.  The truck pulls up at the next house.  
Woody hides behind a fire hydrant.
The Garbage Man hops off the runner, yanks a lever.  The 
truck’s compactor lowers, scoops up the trash bags.  
From behind the hydrant, Woody watches in horror.
The compactor retracts, CRUNCHING the bags remorselessly.

Buzz...!!!  Jessie...!!!

WOODY 

A TINKLE.  Woody turns.  In Andy’s driveway, an upside-down 
recycling bin scurries on little feet into the garage.  
Woody sighs, relieved.

INT. GARAGE - DAY
The Toys cast off the bin.  They are traumatized. 

Andy threw us out...! 

SLINKY

Like we were garbage...!

HAMM

“Junk”!  He called us “junk”! 

MR. POTATO HEAD

              25

How could he...?!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

She SOBS on Mr. Potato Head’s shoulder. 

BUZZ

(to himself)

This doesn’t make any sense...!

Jessie is furious.

JESSIE

I should’a seen this coming!  It’s 
Emily all over again!

She turns and scans the garage -- galvanized, determined.

Sarge was right...!

HAMM

MR. POTATO HEAD
Yeah!  And Woody was wrong!

BUZZ

Wait a minute!  Hold on!  This is no 
time to be hysterical.

HAMM

It’s the perfect time to be 
hysterical!

REX

(hysterical)

Should we be hysterical...?!!!

No!

Yes!

SLINKY

MR. POTATO HEAD

BUZZ

Maybe!  But not right now!
JESSIE (O.S.)

Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeee--hawwwwwwwwww...!!!

Everyone turns.  Jessie is smiling.

JESSIE (CONT'D)
Fellas -- I know what to do!

They follow her gaze.  In the hatchback of Mom’s car is 
Molly’s box of toys, marked SUNNYSIDE.

              26

EXT. ANDY’S YARD - DAY
Woody darts from a tree to a landscape boulder, sneaking 
towards the garage. He peeks out from behind a flowerpot.

WOODY
What the heck...?!

WOODY’S POV -- The Toys clamber into the Donation Box.

INT. CAR / GARAGE - DAY
Buzz stands outside the Donation Box as the other Toys 
clamber in.  Jessie helps the Aliens up into the box.

We should’a done this years ago!  

JESSIE

Jessie, wait...!  What about Woody?!

BUZZ

JESSIE

He’s fine, Buzz!  Andy’s takin’ him 
to college!  Now we need to go!

Buzz looks at her and the others.

You’re right.  Come on!

BUZZ

He helps pass the Aliens up.  Woody approaches, incredulous.

Buzz...?  

Woody...!

WOODY 

BUZZ

WOODY

What’s going on?  Don’t you know this 
box is being donated!

It’s under control!  We have a plan!

BUZZ

We’re going to Day Care!

REX

WOODY 

Day Care?!  What -- have you all lost 
your marbles?!

Didn’t you see?  Andy threw us away!  

MRS. POTATO HEAD

              27

WOODY
No...!  No, no, no!  He was putting 
you in the attic!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Attic?  So how’d we end up on the 
curb?!

WOODY

That was a mistake!  Andy’s Mom 
thought you were trash! 

HAMM

Yeah!  After he put us in a trash 
bag!

And called us “junk”!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

WOODY
I know it looks bad but, guys, ya 
gotta believe me!

Sure thing, “College Boy”!

MR. POTATO HEAD

JESSIE 

Andy’s movin’ on, Woody!  It’s time 
we did the same.

Jessie and the others duck in the box, pull the flaps shut.    

WOODY 

Okay, out of the box!  Everyone, right 
now!  Come on!  Buzz -- gimme a hand.  
We gotta get this thing outta here!

He walks around and tries to push the box out of the car.  

BUZZ 

Woody -- wait!  We need to figure out 
what’s best for every--...

SLAM!!!  The hatchback shuts.  
Buzz and Woody turn.  Through the window, Andy’s Mom walks 
to the driver’s seat, gets in.  Woody and Buzz crouch down. 

WOODY

Oh, great!  Great!!!  It’s gonna take 
us forever to get back here!

The car lurches into gear and drives off.

              28

INT. DONATION BOX / CAR - DAY
The Toys have gathered around Barbie, who is sniffling.  
Mrs. Potato Head pats her shoulder.   

MRS. POTATO HEAD

It’s all right, Barbie.  You’ll be 
okay!

Barbie nods, putting on a brave front.

BARBIE

Well... Molly and I have been growing 
apart for years, it’s just... I can’t 
believe she would throw me away!  

She breaks down again.  Potato Head rolls his eyes.

MR. POTATO HEAD
Welcome to the club, Toots!

Suddenly, the box flaps open and Woody and Buzz vault in.

WOODY

Okay, everyone, listen up...  We can 
get back to Andy’s but we gotta move 
fast.  We’ll hide under the seats 
‘til we get home...

The Toys react, incensed.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Get it through your vinyl noggin, 
Woody -- Andy doesn’t want us anymore! 

WOODY

He was putting you...  In the 
attic!!! 

Jessie goes toe-to-toe with Woody.

He left us...  On the curb!  

JESSIE 

Buzz intervenes.

Alright, calm down!  Both of you!  

BUZZ

WOODY

Okay, fine!  Just wait’ll you see 
what Day Care’s like!

Why...?!  What’s it like?!

REX

              29

WOODY

Day Care is a sad, lonely place for 
washed-up old toys who have no 
owners.

Abruptly, Barbie bursts into tears.

Quite the charmer, aren’t ya?

HAMM

WOODY 

Oh, you’ll see!  As soon as we get to 
Day Care, you’ll be begging to go home.  

The car hits a bump and Woody tumbles.

EXT. DAY CARE, PARKING LOT - DAY
The car pulls into a modest day care center -- Sunnyside -- 
a cinder block building with bright, kid-friendly murals.

INT. / EXT. DONATION BOX / PARKING LOT - DAY
Andy’s Mom pulls out the box, carries it across the lot. 
Inside the box, the Toys peer out the hand slots.

Can anyone see anything?

REX

There’s a playground...!

JESSIE

Through fencing we SEE glimpses of kids running and playing 
with SHOUTS and LAUGHTER.  The Toys look at each other.

We hit the jackpot, Bullseye! 

JESSIE 

So much for “sad and lonely”, eh?

HAMM

WOODY

Okay, calm down, guys.  Let’s keep 
this in perspective...

Perspective?!  This place is perfect!

MR. POTATO HEAD

REX (CONT'D)

Woody, it’s nice!  See, the door has 
a rainbow on it!

              30

INT. LOBBY - DAY
Andy’s Mom is BUZZED through glass doors.  A RECEPTIONIST 
behind a counter types at a computer while a small girl on 
the counter plays with a toy chimp.  Andy’s Mom enters.

Hey, there!

MOM

Wow! Haven’t seen you in ages...  

RECEPTIONIST

Just wanted to drop these old toys off.

MOM

She puts the box on the counter.

Is this Bonnie?!  Look how big you are!  

MOM (CONT'D)

The girl, BONNIE, looks up, then turns to her Mother, shy.

Say hi, sweetie!

RECEPTIONIST

Hi.

BONNIE

How are your kids?  Molly and Andy?

RECEPTIONIST 

MOM

Not kids anymore.  Andy’s going to 
college on Friday.  Can you believe?

The Receptionist opens the box.  Bonnie tries to look in.

You sure they won’t miss these?

RECEPTIONIST 

Nah, they never get played with.

MOM 

Mom departs and the Receptionist folds up the box flaps.

INT. DONATION BOX / HALLWAY - DAY
The Toys peek out as they are carried down a hallway.  

You see any kids...?

MR. POTATO HEAD

Where’s she taking us?

REX

              31

INT. DONATION BOX / BUTTERFLY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
The Box is placed on a counter.  The Receptionist departs. 
In the box, the Toys step up and jostle for a view.

Look...!

Wow!

JESSIE

MR. POTATO HEAD

What?!  What is it?!!!

REX

TOYS’ POV -- An idyllic day care classroom, filled with the 
happy bustle of four- and five-year-olds, playing with toys 
-- dinosaurs, a baby doll, a pink Teddy bear, a Ken doll.
The Toys stare, agog.  Rex jockeys for a peek.

Aaah!  I can’t see!   

REX (CONT'D)

A bell RINGS.  A TEACHER opens the playground door.

Okay, everyone, recess!  C’mon! 

BUTTERFLY ROOM TEACHER

The kids CHEER and flood out on the playground.  The 
Teacher turns off lights, shuts the door behind her. 
IN THE BOX 
Silence.  The room is still.  The Toys speak sotto.

So, now what do we do?

HAMM

WOODY

We go back to Andy’s!  Anyone see an 
exit?

MR. POTATO HEAD

Exit schmexit!  Let’s get played 
with!

BUZZ
Careful!  These toys might be jealous 
of new arrivals!
REX

I wanna see!  It’s my turn!

Rex presses in.  The Toys react.

              32

Oooff...!!!

Whoa!

Hey!

BUZZ 

SLINKY

HAMM

The whole box tilts and falls off the counter -- SPLAT!!! 
The Toys spill out.  They look up.
Around the room, all the Day Care Toys stare back. 
A Jack In The Box pops up.

New Toys! 

JACK IN THE BOX

They all CHEER and burst into smiles.
Jessie shakes hands with a ROCK MONSTER toy.

Well, howdy!  Glad to meetcha!

JESSIE

Buzz extends his hand to a ROBOT toy.

Buzz Lightyear, at your service.

BUZZ

Hamm, Slinky and Barbie shake hands with an OCTOPUS toy.

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

HAMM

Rex laughs, circled by adoring little dinosaurs. 
An Insect Man ACTION FIGURE helps Mrs. Potato Head get up.

MRS. POTATO HEAD
(reaches for his bicep)

Oooh, thank you!
Oh, may I?  Ohhh!

He flexes obligingly.  She feels his arm, GIGGLES.  Mr. 
Potato Head looks on.  He flexes his own arm.  It sags.  
A Crane toy circles the Aliens.  They gaze up, rapturous.

The Claw...!!!

ALIENS

SFX -- HONK!  HONK!  Everyone turns.  

              33

A Tonka Truck races forward, then backs up in a quick 180 
arc, revealing a large pink Teddy bear, LOTSO, in its bed.  
Lotso taps a Tinker Toy cane and the truck bed rises, 
“dumping” him out.  Like Bob Hope stepping off the links in 
Palm Springs, Lotso exudes an easy, cheerful charisma.  

LOTSO

Well, hello there!  I thought I heard 
new voices!  Welcome to Sunnyside, 
folks!  I’m Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear!  
But, please, call me Lotso! 

Buzz steps up, offers a hand.
BUZZ

Buzz Lightyear.  We come in pea...

Lotso grabs Buzz, lifts him in a smothering hug.  

LOTSO
(chuckling)

First thing you gotta know about 
me...  I’m a hugger!!

He releases Buzz, looks at the other Toys.

LOTSO (CONT'D)
Oh, look at y’all!  You been through 
a lot today, haven’t you?  

Oh, it’s been horrible!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

LOTSO

Well, you’re safe now.  We’re all 
cast-offs here -- we been dumped, 
donated, yard-saled, second-handed, 
and just plain thrown out.  But just 
you wait -- you’ll find being donated 
was the best thing that ever happened 
to ya!  

Woody scoffs, but Rex steps up excitedly.

REX 

Mr. Lotso...?  Do toys here get 
played with every day?

All day long.  Five days a week.

LOTSO

JESSIE

But what happens when the kids grow 
up?

              34

Lotso steps to a wall of day-care class photos.

LOTSO

Well, now, I’ll tell ya -- when the 
kids get old, new ones come in.  When 
they get old, new ones replace them.  
You’ll never be outgrown or 
neglected.  Never abandoned or 
forgotten.  No owners means no 
heartbreak.  

The Toys are overjoyed. Even Woody is taken by this vision.

Yeee-hawww..!!!  

JESSIE

It’s a miracle!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

MR. POTATO HEAD

(to Woody)

And you wanted us to stay at Andy’s!

Because we’re Andy’s toys!

WOODY

Lotso puts an arm around Woody.

LOTSO

So you got donated by this “Andy”, 
huh?  Well, it’s his loss, Sheriff!  
He can’t hurt you no more.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 

WOODY

Lotso cuts him off.

LOTSO

Now let’s get you all settled in.  
Ken?!  Where is that boy?  Ken...?!  
New toys!

A Ken doll appears in an upper window of a doll house. 

KEN 
(to Lotso)

Far out!  Hey, hi, everybody! 
Down in a jiff, Lotso!

He rides down in an elevator and opens the door.  
ON KEN -- Slip-on shoes, double-pleated shorts, and an 
unbuttoned animal-print shirt that reveals his ripped abs.  
He addresses the Toys with an air of boundless self-regard.

              35

So.  Who’s ready for Ken’s Dream Tour?

KEN (CONT'D)

LOTSO
Let’s show our new friends where 
they’ll be stayin’!

KEN 

Folks, if you wanna step right this--
He turns, sees Barbie.  She looks up, sees him.  
Sparks fly.  MUSIC swells.  Destiny calls.  They approach.

Hi!  I’m Ken.

KEN (CONT'D)

BARBIE
(breathless)

Barbie.  
Have we ever me--...?

KEN

Huh-uh...!  I would’ve remembered!
(Barbie GIGGLES)
Love your leg warmers.

Nice ascot.
Lotso breaks the spell.

BARBIE

LOTSO

C’mon, Ken!  Recess don’t last 
forever!

Right on, Lotso!  This way everyone!

KEN 

He extends a gentlemanly arm.  Barbie giggles, takes it.

LOTSO

You got a lot to look forward to, folks 
-- the Little Ones love new toys!

He leads them off.  Rex, Buzz, and Woody trail behind.

BUZZ
What a nice bear!
REX

And he smells like strawberries!

Woody sighs, exasperated. 

              36

As they walk, Ken addresses the Toys like a tour leader.

KEN

Folks, if I can share, here at 
Sunnyside, we’ve got, well, just 
about anything a Toy could ask for.
Lotso leads them past shelves of toy supplies.

LOTSO

Spare parts, super glue, and enough 
fresh batteries to choke a Hungry-
Hungry Hippo.

CLOSET DOOR
Lotso flings open a utility closet, revealing a spa-like 
workshop in which smaller Toys fix up bigger Toys -- 
stitching rips, etc.  The Toys gasp, impressed.

LOTSO (CONT'D)

Think you’re gettin’ old?  Well, stop 
your worryin’!

KEN 

Our repair spa will keep you stuffed, 
puffed, and lightly buffed!

An Elephant plushie is getting his belly re-stuffed.  He 
SNEEZES.  Stuffing flies everywhere.
IN THE CLASSROOM
As the tour continues, Ken gestures to his Dream House.  

KEN (CONT'D)

And this, well, this is where I live   
-- Ken’s Dream House.  It has a disco, 
it’s got a dune buggy...  And a whole 
room just for trying on clothes.

You have everything!!!

BARBIE

KEN

Everything except someone to share it 
with.

He looks down, walks off.  Barbie sighs, about to faint. 
Lotso reaches a bathroom door at the end of the room.

LOTSO

You need anything at all, you just 
come talk to me.  Here we are...!

              37

Lotso raps the door with his cane.  It’s opened by a large 
baby doll, BIG BABY, with a lazy, drooping eye.  Big Baby   
COOS, peers out at the Toys.  They stare up in wonder. 

LOTSO (CONT'D)

Well, thank you, Big Baby.  Why don’t 
you come meet our new friends?

He throws an arm around Big Baby in Toy-solidarity.

LOTSO (CONT'D)

Poor Baby!  We were thrown out 
together, me n’ him.  Abandoned by 
the same owner!

INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Lotso leads the Toys through a bathroom.  

LOTSO

But we don’t need owners here at 
Sunnyside!  We own ourselves!  We’re 
masters of our own fate...!  We 
control our own destiny!

Mr. Potato Head slips and falls, losing his parts.

LOTSO (CONT'D)
Uh, watch out for puddles...

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY
Lotso leads the Toys into a new classroom.  The Day Care 
Toys here are scuffier and more toddler-appropriate. 

LOTSO

And here’s where you folks’ll be 
staying -- the Caterpillar Room!  

The Toys gaze up in awe.  There’s kid stuff everywhere: 
tiny tables and chairs, finger paintings, wood blocks, 
banners of the alphabet, wire cubby bins, etc.  The whole 
beautiful, child-centric universe of day care.  

JESSIE
Look at this place!
BUZZ 

[Whistles]

Holy moly, guacamole!

HAMM

              38

Jackpot, baby!

MR. POTATO HEAD 

Whoa, puppy!

Wow!

SLINKY

REX

A TOY TRAIN weaves through the room, blowing its WHISTLE. 
The Potato Heads look around in wonder.

MRS. POTATO HEAD

(fighting tears)

It’s so beautiful! 

Woody is awestruck.  Something nudges him.  A RINGING.  

What the...?

WOODY

He looks down.  An old Fisher Price Chatter Telephone is 
bumping into him.  Woody kneels down, friendly.

Oh, hey, little fella...

Woody (CONT'D)

LOTSO

How long’s it been since y’all got 
played with?

It’s been years! 

SLINKY

LOTSO 

Well, just you wait. In a few minutes 
that bell’s gonna ring and you’ll get 
the playtime you’ve been dreaming of.  

Play!  Real play!!!  I can’t wait!!! 

REX

LOTSO

Now, if you’ll excuse us, we best be 
headin’ back.  Welcome to Sunnyside, 
folks!

Lotso climbs back into the Tonka Truck.  The Toys wave.

Thank you!

REX

Thank you there, Buddy Boy!

HAMM

              39

MR. POTATO HEAD 

Take care, Pinky!
BUZZ

Goodbye, Mr. Lotso!  Thank you!

Goodbye...!  

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Barbie turns to Ken -- an end-of-the-first-date moment.

Will I see you again?

BARBIE

KEN

Oh, I’ll see you tonight.  In my 
dreams.

She giggles.  They stare.  It’s like they could both 
spontaneously combust.  At the bathroom door, Lotso waits.

Ken...!  Let’s get a move on! 

LOTSO

Ken turns to Barbie, takes her hands.

KEN 

Barbie, come with me!  Live in my 
Dream House!  I know it’s crazy!  I 
know we’ve just met!  Aw, heck -- you 
don’t know me from GI Joe.  But when 
I look at you I feel like we were...

...Made for each other!

KEN & BARBIE

They gasp, thunderstruck.  Barbie turns, gazes to the Toys.  
Jessie grins and winks.  Mrs. Potato Head waves -- Go! 

Yay!

BARBIE

She gives a leg kick.  Ken pumps his fist.  

KEN
Yessssssss...!!!

Lotso calls again.

Ken...!  

LOTSO

Coming, Lotso!

KEN

              40

Ken leads Barbie to the Truck and they hop in, giddy.  
Lotso taps his cane and the Truck roars off.  Big Baby is 
the last to exit, closing the door -- CLICK -- behind them.  
Through windows, children are heard LAUGHING and PLAYING.  
The Toys turn and wander toward the playground door.  

Sounds like kids to me...!

HAMM

REX

Oh, I wanna get played with!  Why 
can’t time go faster?!!!

How many ya reckon are out there?!

JESSIE

Oh, they sound so sweet!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Woody looks at them, knowing he’s fighting a losing battle.

WOODY

Look, everyone, it’s nice here, I 
admit.  But we need to go home...!

The Toys glance at each other.  Jessie steps forward.

JESSIE

We can have a whole new life here, 
Woody.  A chance to make kids happy 
again. 

SLINKY
Why don’t you stay?

Yeah, Woody!  Stay with us!

REX

HAMM
Come on, Woodster!

You’ll get played with...!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Stay here!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

You can make a new kid happy!

JESSIE

I can’t!  No, no!  Guys, really, no!

WOODY

The Toys are taken aback.  Woody struggles to stay calm.

              41

WOODY (CONT'D)

I have a kid.  You have a kid -- 
Andy!  And if he wants us at college, 
or in the attic, well, then our job 
is to be there for him!  Now I’m 
going home!  Anyone wants to join me 
is welcome!  C’mon, Buzz!

He heads off.  Buzz stays put.  Woody turns back.

Buzz...?

WOODY (CONT'D)

Buzz -- torn -- steps up to Woody, sober and gentle.  

BUZZ

Our mission with Andy’s complete, 
Woody.

What...?! 

WOODY

BUZZ

And what’s important now is we stay 
together.

WOODY

We wouldn’t even be together if it 
weren’t for Andy!  Look under your 
boot, Buzz!  You too, Jessie!  Whose 
name is written there?

The Toys stare at the ground.  Rex pipes up.

REX

Maybe Andy doesn’t care about us any 
more?

WOODY

Of course he does!  He cares about 
all of you!  He was putting you in 
the attic -- I saw!  You can’t just 
turn your back on him now!

Jessie steps forward -- incensed.

JESSIE

Woody -- wake up!  It’s over!  Andy 
is all grown up!

Woody stares, trying to contain his anger.  

WOODY 

Okay, fine!  Perfect!  I can’t 
believe how selfish you all are.

              42

Jessie glares back.  No one moves.  

WOODY (CONT'D)

So this is it?  After all we’ve been 
through?

Buzz steps forward, offers a handshake.  Woody looks at 
Buzz.  He fixes his hat, turns away.  Buzz is stung.  
Woody walks to the hall door.  Bullseye follows.

Bullseye, no.  You need to stay!

WOODY (CONT’D)

He moves on.  Bullseye again tries to follow.

WOODY (CONT'D)
Bullseye, no!  I said stay!
Look -- I don’t want you left alone 
in the attic, okay?  Now, stay.

(softens)

Bullseye retreats.  Jessie puts a consoling hand on him.  
KEYS in a LOCK.  The Toys turn.

Bonnie...?  Bonnie!

BONNIE’S MOM (O.S.)

Woody looks at them, doesn’t know what else to say.

I gotta go.

WOODY 

The Toys scatter.  Woody hides behind the door just as 
Bonnie’s Mom enters.

Bonnie?  You in here?

BONNIE’S MOM

Woody sneaks out the door, into the hall.
CLOSE ON -- Buzz and Jessie, watching.

INT. HALLWAY
TEACHERS CHAT at the end of the hallway.
Woody peeks out from behind a garbage can, tip-toes into 
the hall, turns.  A janitor cart approaches.  Woody falls 
limp.  The cart passes over Woody, leaving the hall empty.
A whistling JANITOR pushes the cart down the hallway.   
TILT DOWN to FIND Woody holding the underside of the cart.

WOODY POV -- He rolls through the lobby, toward the exit...

              43

C’mon, c’mon...

WOODY

...and veers into a bathroom.

No, no...!

WOODY (CONT'D)

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
The Janitor cleans the sinks.  Woody sneaks into a nearby 
stall.  Looks up, sees an open window.  
He tears a square of toilet paper, places it on the seat, 
climbs up the tank lid, leaps to the toilet paper roll, 
jumps to the top of the stall, backs toward the window.
At the sink, the Janitor looks in the mirror, starts.

What the heck?

JANITOR 

Woody freezes.  The Janitor stares at the mirror, Woody in 
its reflection.
RACK FOCUS -- The Janitor reaches up, wipes a stain off.

That’s better.

JANITOR (CONT’D)

RACK BACK -- The window in the mirror.  Woody’s gone.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY
Woody finds himself above the playground.  Below, Bonnie 
plays hopscotch by herself.  Her Mom walks over.

BONNIE’S MOM
Bonnie...?  There you are.  C’mon, 
honey.  Time to go home. 

She leads Bonnie off.  Woody climbs up a drainage pipe to 
the roof.  He runs across the roof, stops at the edge.
POV, PANNING -- A high wall surrounds the day care campus.   
Woody frowns.  A gust lifts his hat off, blows it away.  

Oh, no!  No, no, no...!

WOODY

              44

His hat lands under a kite tangled on the roof top.  Woody 
stares at the kite -- an idea.

CUT TO:
Woody runs across the roof, kite over his head.  He leaps 
and soars across the playground and over the wall.  He 
glides down, makes a perfect landing, and laughs, pleased.  
Abruptly, another gust hits, yanking him high in the air.  
Woody looks at the ground far below.  The wind takes the 
kite higher still, dipping and swirling frenetically.
Woody panics, wrapping himself around the kite’s cross-bar.  
The bar snaps.  The kite plummets.  Woody tries desperately 
to flap the kite wings, but it doesn’t slow his fall.
He crashes into a tree, hitting branches on the way down.  
He falls from the tree and stops -- eyes shut -- inches 
above the pavement.  Opens one eye.
Slowly, his pull-string lifts him upward.

WOODY (CONT'D)

(voice box)
Reach for the sky!

Woody dangles from a branch, trying to free himself.  
Bonnie approaches, playing hopscotch.  Woody sees her, goes 
limp.  She bumps into Woody, looks up.  Looks around.  She 
tugs Woody off the branch.  His pull-string retracts.

WOODY (CONT'D)
You’re my favorite deputy!

(voice box)

She smiles.  HONK HONK!

Bonnie! 

Coming!

BONNIE’S MOM (O.S.)

BONNIE

She shoves Woody in her backpack, zips it up, runs off.  
IN THE BACKPACK
Woody is trapped.  

Oh, great!

WOODY

              45

As Bonnie and her Mom drive off, CRANE DOWN to REVEAL... 
Woody’s hat, lying on the ground. 

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY
Bullseye whimpers, stares at the door. Jessie consoles him.

Oh, it’s gonna be okay, Bullseye.

JESSIE

BUZZ

Woody’s going to college with Andy.  
It’s what he’s always wanted.
MR. POTATO HEAD

He’s crazy!  College is no place for 
a toy!

Toys are for play time!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

HAMM

Speaking of play time...!  They’re 
lining up out there!

Hamm, at the window, is spying on the playground.  

How many?

BUZZ

There must be dozens!

HAMM

Ohhh...!  I can hardly wait!

REX

BUZZ
Places, everyone!

The Toys scramble into play position.  
Buzz notices the Day Care Toys edging away from the door -- 
ducking, hiding, trembling, diving for cover.  
The bell RINGS.  Kids SHRIEK.  Footsteps THUNDER.
Rex spreads his arms and runs to the playground door.

At last!  I’m gonna get played with!

REX

Uh, Rex...?

BUZZ

              46

Come to Papa!

REX

BOOM!  The door bursts open, swatting Rex across the room.  
A horde of squealing, hyped-up TODDLERS enter.  
The Toys go limp.  Buzz closes his helmet.
The toddlers descend on the Toys with SHRIEKS of delight.  
Toys are snatched up by eager, excited hands.
A Boy and Girl stretch Slinky until his coil goes haywire.  
A Boy smashes the Toy Train into a wall.  
A Girl picks up Buzz, bringing him straight to her mouth.
A Girl dips Jessie’s hair in paint and uses her as a brush. 
A Boy runs across the room, with Bullseye on top of a Corn 
Popper toy. Bullseye slides off, gets caught in its wheels.
Hamm is bathed in glue...  Then coated in green glitter. 
A Girl “rides” Rex, snapping his tail off.  
The Aliens are squashed as a Boy sits on them.
A Boy picks up Mr. Potato Head’s eye, shoves it up his nose.  
A Girl uses Buzz to hammer a square peg into a round hole.
BUZZ POV -- Buzz smashes the peg.  Bam, Bam, Bam!  
A Boy runs by, tugs the Girl’s hair.  She screams, tosses 
Buzz away.  He lands on the window sill. 
BUZZ POV -- Across the playgound, in the Butterfly Room, a 
class of Four- and Five-Year-Olds play lovingly with Lotso 
and the other toys.
Buzz frowns -- Why is it Heaven in there and Hell in here?  
Abruptly, a HAND grabs him, pulls him back into the fray.

INT. BONNIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
CLOSE ON -- Woody.  His string is pulled again.

WOODY
(voicebox)

I’d like to join your posse, boys, 
but first I’m gonna sing a little 
song.

Bonnie holds Woody, smiles.

BONNIE

A sheriff..!!  Move over, Mr. 
Pricklepants!  We have a guest!

She plunks Woody at a small table circled by other toys -- 
a HEDGEHOG, a UNICORN, and a TRICERATOPS.  

You want some coffee?

BONNIE (CONT'D)

She sets out cups, pretends to pour.

BONNIE (CONT'D)

It’s good for you!  But don’t drink 
too much or you’ll hafta... Hafta...

She dances from foot to foot.

Be right back...!

BONNIE (CONT'D)

She runs out the door.  Woody comes alive, looks around.  
The other Toys stay frozen.

Psst!  Hey!  Hello!  Hi -- Excuse me! 

WOODY 

The Hedgehog, MR. PRICKLEPANTS, comes alive briefly.

Shhh!

MR. PRICKLEPANTS 

Can you tell me where I am?

WOODY

Shhhhhh!!!

MR. PRICKLEPANTS

The guy’s just askin’ a question!

UNICORN

              48

MR. PRICKLEPANTS

Well, excuse me, I’m trying to stay 
in character!

He freezes again.  The Unicorn, friendly, turns to Woody.

UNICORN
My name’s Buttercup. 

Shhhh!!!!

I’m Trixie!

Shhhhh!!!!

MR. PRICKLEPANTS

TRICERATOPS

MR. PRICKLEPANTS

Shhhhhh!!!!!

TRIXIE

BOTH
Shhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!
WOODY

Guys, hey!  I don’t know where I am!

TRIXIE

We’re either in a cafe in Paris, or a 
coffee shop in New Jersey.  I’m 
pretty sure I just came back from the 
doctor with life-changing news!

Woody is baffled.

BUTTERCUP

We do a lot of improv here. Just stay 
loose, have fun, you’ll be fine.

No, no, no, I...

WOODY

A FLUSH.  Woody gets back in his pose.  Bonnie runs in. 

Who wants lunch?  Beep! Boop! Beep!

BONNIE

She pushes buttons on a toy microwave oven, opens the door, 
removes a plastic hamburger, plunks it in front of Woody.

BONNIE (CONT'D)
It has a secret ingredient...

She lifts the top bun...

              49

...Jellybeans!

BONNIE (CONT'D)

Bonnie eats a jellybean, pulls Woody’s string.

WOODY
(voicebox)

Somebody’s poisoned the water hole!

Poison?!

BONNIE

She spits the jellybean -- it sticks to Pricklepants’s head.

Who would do such a mean thing?!
She GASPS and becomes a different character.

BONNIE (CONT'D)

BONNIE (CONT'D)

(as Witch)

Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!! 

She turns.  SMASH ZOOM to a DOLL on the shelf behind her. 

The scary witch!!

BONNIE (CONT'D)

Bonnie picks up the Doll, flies it around the room.

BONNIE (CONT'D)

Look out!  She’s using her witch 
powers!  

CLOSE ON -- Woody.

I know where to hide!

BONNIE (AS WOODY) (CONT'D)

INT. BONNIE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
The toy box at the foot of Bonnie’s bed.  It creaks open.  
Bonnie peeks out, grabs a Totoro, pulls it closed again.

INT. TOY BOX - DAY
Bonnie and Woody huddle in the dark.

She’ll never find us in here!

BONNIE

Bonnie surreptitiously lifts the Doll into view.

              50

What’s wrong...?

BONNIE (CONT'D)

She turns.  Sees the doll, SCREAMS.

INT. BONNIE’S BEDROOM - DAY
The toy box tips over, spilling Bonnie and her Toys.  

BONNIE 

She found us!  We need a spaceship to 
get away!

She runs off into a closet.  The Toys come alive.

TRIXIE
You’re doin’ great!

MR. PRICKLEPANTS
Are you classically trained?

WOODY

Look, I just need to know how to get 
outta here...!

BUTTERCUP
There IS NO WAY OUT!!!

Woody is stunned.

BUTTERCUP (CONT'D)

Just kidding.  Door’s right over 
there.

The Doll gets up, greets Woody.

DOLL

Well, Cowboy, you just jumped right 
in, didn’t ya?  I’m Dolly.

...Uh, Woody.

WOODY

They shake.

DOLLY

“Woody”?  Really?  You’re gonna stick 
with that?  ‘Cuz now’s your chance to 
change it -- new room and all. That’s 
coming from a doll named “Dolly”. 

A PEA POD TOY zips open behind Woody.  He turns.

              51

PEA #1
Who’s the new guy?
PEA #2

Are you a real cowboy?

Well, actually, I....

WOODY

PEA #3

‘Course he’s not, pea-brain!  He 
don’t even have a hat!

I do too have a...  My hat?!

WOODY

Told ‘ya!

PEA #3

I found the spaceship!!

BONNIE (O.S.)

Show time!

MR. PRICKLEPANTS

Woody and the Toys go lifeless as Bonnie runs out of the 
closet with makeshift shoebox rocket. 

BONNIE (AS WOODY) 

Quick!  Fasten your seatbelts!  Close 
your tray tables!

She stuffs the toys in the box, drops it on a bedsheet.

BONNIE (CONT’D)

Hold on, it might get a little bumpy! 
3...  2...  1...!  BLAST-OFF!!

She pulls the sheet taut.  The Toys fly into the air.
SLOW MOTION -- Woody soaring.  The moment is magical.
Woody and the others tumble onto the bed.  Bonnie flops 
down with them, hugging them close.

BONNIE (CONT'D)

Yeee-haaaaw!!!  You saved us, cowboy!  
You’re our hero!!!

She pulls Woody to her cheek -- just like Andy once did. 
Woody glances at the other Toys.  They smile at him.  
He smiles back.  That was great.

              52

INT. CATERPILLAR CLASSROOM - DUSK
The Toys come to life, groaning. 

Oh, I’ve got a kink in my slink.

SLINKY

Rex staggers by, tail missing.

My tail...!  Where’s my tail?!

REX 

Buzz sits up, dazed.  
Hamm pulls his cork.  Detritus spills out.  He strains.  
POP -- a Weeble pops out.  Hamm picks up a plastic arm.

Someone need a hand?

HAMM

He tosses it to Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head -- their parts 
completely jumbled.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Where’s my nose...  Here’s 
your arm...  Honey, the 
moustache...?
Buzz straightens up -- back CRACKING.

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Here it is...  Gimme that, 
that’s mine...

BUZZ
I don’t recall play time being quite 
that strenuous.  

Rex pulls his tail from a peg board.

Andy never played with us like that!

REX

Jessie peels a decal off Bullseye’s nose.

We have to make the best of it.

JESSIE

MR. POTATO HEAD

But these toddlers!  They don’t know 
how to play with us!

REX

They’re too young!
HAMM

They’re sticky!

              53

MRS. POTATO HEAD 

We should be in the Butterfly Room!  
With the big kids!

MR. POTATO HEAD

That’s right!

You said it!

HAMM

BUZZ 

We’ll get this straightened out -- 
I’ll go talk to Lotso about moving 
us to the other room.

He clambers up a table, leaps to the bathroom door knob.  
It doesn’t move.  

Blast.  Try that one!

BUZZ (CONT'D)

Jessie leaps to the hallway door latch.

It’s locked!

JESSIE

At the playground door, Slinky tests the door knob.

Same here!

SLINKY

Buzz drops down, points.

BUZZ
Try the windows.

Hamm, on the sill, examines a window lock.

HAMM

Eh, negatory.  It’s a Fenster- 
Schneckler 380.  Finest childproof 
lock in the world.

We’re trapped!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Wait!  Did anyone notice the transom?

BUZZ

What’s a transom, Buzz?

REX

Buzz looks up -- atop the hallway door is an open transom. 

Oh, great!  How do we get up there?!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Buzz narrows his eyes, thinking.

              54

INT. CATERPILLAR CLASSROOM - LATER
The Toys hold a Fisher Price Corn Popper.  Buzz, a loop of 
red yarn wrapped across his chest, stands at the rear.

BUZZ

All right, everyone!  On three!  
One... Two...

Three!!!

JESSIE

They take off, pushing the popper at top speed. 

Let go!

JESSIE (CONT'D)

The Toys drop away, leaving Buzz to jump onto the handle.
The popper strikes an upturned table, lofting Buzz in the 
air.  He grabs a string that runs across the room, using it 
like a zip-line.  As he reaches the end, Buzz leaps off, 
expands his wings and flies towards a display of hanging 
paper-mache caterpillars, using their legs to swing from 
one to another.  On the ground, Hamm makes signal.

Jump!

HAMM

Bullseye and Rex jump off a shelf, catapulting a broom 
forward.  Buzz bounces off the broom, towards the transom.  
He flips, twists, and lands -- safe.  The Toys rejoice.

He did it!!! 

REX

Way to go, Buzz!

JESSIE

Buzz casts part of his yarn down to the Toys.  They run and 
grab it.  Buzz turns to the hallway, stops.
BUZZ POV -- In the hall below, a pair of tough Day Care 
Toys, TWITCH (Bug Man) and CHUNK (Rock Man) saunter past.

You think they had a fun playtime?

CHUNK

Shhh...!!!  They might hear you!

TWITCH

Buzz frowns.  O.S. GIGGLING.  Buzz turns.  Down the hall, 
Ken and Barbie say goodbye at the Butterfly Room door.

              55

KEN

Okay, now you start.
BARBIE

I...

...love...

...you.

KEN

BARBIE

KEN

See?!  That time I said “love”.  
Okay, now, me first.

CLOSE ON -- Buzz.  He stifles a dry heave.

Okay, okay, okay....!

BARBIE

I...

...love...

KEN

BARBIE

KEN

...you!  See what I mean?  It changes 
every time!

You are so smart!

BARBIE

As the Tough Toys pass, they drag Ken away.

C’mon, Romeo...  We’re late.

TWITCH

I’ll wait up for you!

BARBIE

Kisses...!

KEN

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Buzz -- using the red yarn -- rappels down into the hall. 
He unties the yarn and steals off down the hallway.  
He reaches the Teacher’s Lounge, approaches cautiously. 

              56

INT. TEACHERS’ LOUNGE - NIGHT
Buzz peeks in.  Ken, Twitch and Chunk approach a vending 
machine.  Ken opens the bottom flap and they all go inside.  
Buzz frowns.  He walks to the vending machine.  Suddenly -- 
strangely -- a cow MOOOOS.
Buzz looks around, confused.  Then he looks up.
Silhouetted in the top of a glowing vending machine are Ken 
and the rest of his Gang.  A Rooster crows:  COCKADOODLE-
DOO!!  This is followed by MUFFLED LAUGHS and HUBBUB.
Buzz approaches the machine.  From inside come VOICES.  

Yeah, all right!  Let’s go again!

GANG (O.S.)

Buzz pushes open the dispenser flap, climbs in.  Above him, 
a pig OINKS loudly.  More LAUGHS and GRIPES.

INT. VENDING MACHINE - NIGHT
Buzz climbs up rows of candy bars and potato chips.  He 
gets to the top, sneaks towards the light.  In the top of 
the vending machine, a Gang of toys sits around a table.

KEN

All right, place yer bets!  Any 
splits?  Here we go! 

The Gang throws batteries, Monopoly money, other items into 
a pot.  Stretch the Octopus pulls the cord on a Farmer Says 
toy.  As the arrow spins, the Gang roots for their bets.

GANG 

C’mon, Duckie, Duckie!  Big Pig!  Big 
Pig...!  Turkey!  Gimme the Turkey!!

Ken waves his hand over the table.

All right.  No more bets.
The spinning arrow stops on “Duck”. 

KEN

Here is a duck: “Quack, quack”.

FARMER SAYS TOY

Yes!  Yes!  Come to Mama!

STRETCH

Stretch scoops up the pile of money.  The others GROAN.  

              57

Stretch takes the round. 

KEN

The game continues, Ken presiding.

KEN

Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly. 
Coyotes wild. Changing two double AA's.
Hey, what do you guys think of the 
new recruits?  Any Keepers?

(as he changes money:)

Nah, disposable...!  

SPARKS

Landfill!

STRETCH (CONT'D)

Cowgirl...?  Dinosaur...? 

KEN

Toddler fodder! 

TWITCH

They start placing bets again.

KEN 

How ‘bout that Spaceguy?  He could be 
useful.

Buzz reacts, listening. 

CHUNK

He ain’t the sharpest knife in the... 
place where they keep the knives.

Neither are you, Chunk.

SPARKS

LAUGHS.  Twitch teases Ken.

TWITCH

You got a little Keeper yourself, 
didn’t’cha, Ken?
KEN

Hey!  Lay off, Twitch!  Barbie’s 
different!

Mr. Softy over here...!

STRETCH

Whaddaya expect from a girls toy?

CHUNK

              58

Ken stands, furious.

KEN

I’m not a girls toy!  I’m not!  Why 
do you guys keep saying that?!!!

Twitch waves a hand.

TWITCH

All them Toys are disposable.  We’ll 
be lucky if they last us a week!

Buzz reacts.  He turns to go...  And bumps into Big Baby.  
Big Baby tosses Buzz on the table.  The Gang quickly grabs 
and subdues him.  Ken smirks. 

Well, well, looky who we have here.

KEN

BUZZ
Stop!  Let me go!

He struggles.  Ken narrows his eyes.

Take him to “The Library”.

KEN

Nooooooo!

BUZZ

A sock puppet is pulled over Buzz’s head.

CUT TO:

INT. BONNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bonnie sleeps -- toys tucked next to her.  Woody carefully 
slips from under the covers.  Bonnie stirs, moves her arm.  
Woody freezes, leg in the air.  She settles back to sleep.  
Woody tiptoes across the bed, looks around the room.
ZOOM IN -- Bonnie’s backpack, hanging from her door handle.
Woody pushes a chair to the door, climbs up, lifts a cape.  
The address on the backpack is revealed -- 1225 Sycamore. 

1225 Sycamore!

WOODY

Woody...!  What’re you doing?  

MR. PRICKLEPANTS (O.S.)

Woody turns.  Bonnie’s Toys are watching from the bed.

              59

I... I gotta get out of here!

WOODY

TRIXIE
You’re leaving?!  

Didn’t you have fun today?

BUTTERCUP

WOODY

Of course I did!  More ‘n I’ve had in 
years, but...  Y’see, I belong to 
someone else...  

He holds up his boot, where “ANDY” is written.

Who’s “Yid-nah”?

BUTTERCUP

I believe it’s pronounced “Yid-nay”.

MR. PRICKLEPANTS

Guys -- it says “Andy”!

DOLLY

WOODY

He’s my Bonnie...!  And he’s leaving 
soon.  I gotta get home!

Where’s home?

PEA POD

WOODY 

Elm Street.  234 Elm.  
You guys have a map?

(thinking)

We’re on it, Cowboy.  Trixie...?

DOLLY

Trixie giggles.

I’ll fire up the computer!

TRIXIE

INT. STORAGE CLOSET - NIGHT
The sock is pulled off Buzz’s head.  He’s tied to a toy 
chair in a closet lit with an overhead bulb.  In shadows, 
Lotso’s Henchmen lurk.  Buzz struggles to free himself.

              60

BUZZ

Unhand me, you cowards!  I demand to 
talk to Lotso!

KEN

Zip it, Buck Rogers!  You don’t talk 
to Lotso ‘til we say you can...

Abruptly, the door opens.  Lotso stands, astonished.

LOTSO

Ken...?!  What’s going on here?! 
Why’s this Toy tied up?

He...  He got out, Lotso!

KEN

LOTSO

Got out?  Oh, no, no, no!  This isn’t 
how we treat our guests!   

Lotso approaches Buzz, begins untying him.

LOTSO (CONT'D)

F.A.O. my Schwartz...!  There you go. 
I’m so sorry.  

He frees Buzz.  Buzz stands, casting a dark look at Ken.

Lotso, there’s been a mistake.  

BUZZ

LOTSO

A mistake...?!!!
BUZZ

The children in the Caterpillar Room 
are not age-appropriate for me and my 
friends.  We respectfully request a 
transfer to the Butterfly Room.

LOTSO

(gestures grandly)

Well, request granted!

But, Lotso...

KEN 

LOTSO 

Hush now, Kenneth!  This Toy’s shown 
initiative!  Leadership!  Why, I’d 
say we found ourselves a Keeper!  
Hear that, everyone?!  We got a 
Keeper!

(to others)

              61

Lotso lifts Buzz’s arm -- World Champion!  His Gang 
applauds dutifully.  Lotso throws his arm around Buzz.

LOTSO (CONT'D)

We’re callin’ you up to the Big 
Leagues, son!  From now on, you’ll 
have anything you want! 

Excellent!  I’ll go get my friends.

BUZZ

Lotso stops.  

LOTSO

Whoa, whoa!  Hold on there, Boss!  
Those Caterpillar kids need someone 
to play with...!
BUZZ

But my friends don’t belong there!

LOTSO 

Oh, none of us do!  I agree!  Which is 
why -- for the good of our community -- 
we ask the newer toys, the stronger 
ones, to take on the hardships the 
rest of us can’t bear anymore.

Buzz frowns.

Well, I... I guess that makes sense.

BUZZ

Lotso smiles.

BUZZ
But I can’t accept.  We’re a family.  
We stay together.

Lotso’s smile fades.  

LOTSO

Family man, eh?  I understand.  
Put him back in the “Time Out” chair.

(sharply)

Big Baby grabs Buzz and slams him into the toy chair. 

What are you...?  What?!  Unhand me!

BUZZ

Bring in The Bookworm.

LOTSO 

              62

Ken whistles.  A RUSTLING from a shelf above, where rows of 
files are cluttered.

Hold on...  Here it is!  

BOOKWORM (O.S.)

An aged Toy -- The Bookworm -- pushes aside files.

It was filed under “Lightyear”.

BOOKWORM

He tosses a small booklet down to Lotso.  Lotso opens the 
booklet, flips through it.  Buzz looks close, reacts -- 
it’s a Buzz Lightyear Instruction Manual.

LOTSO

Let’s see here...  Accessories...  
Maintenance...  Oh, here we go!
(reading)
“Remove screws to access battery 
compartment...”

Big Baby pushes Buzz down, holding him while Sparks opens 
Buzz’s battery compartment.  Screws drop to the floor.

What are you doing?!  Let go of me!

BUZZ

LOTSO 

(reading)

“To return your Buzz Lightyear Action 
Figure to its original factory 
settings, slide the switch from PLAY 
to DEMO...”

Lotso looks up, nods.  Twitch looks -- inside the panel is 
a MODE switch.   He reaches for it.  Buzz struggles.

Stop!  No...!  No...!!!  NOOOOO!!!  

BUZZ

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
The Toys sit near the door.  The echo of Buzz’s scream is 
heard.  They turn.

What was that?

JESSIE

Sounds like it came from the hall!

HAMM

I’ll see what it was!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

              63

She marches to the door and plucks out her remaining eye.  
She holds it under the door, sweeping it back and forth.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Mrs. Potato Head’s Eye, held by her hand, looks up and down 
the hallway.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
The Toys gather around her.

Whaddaya see?  Anything...?

JESSIE

POV, PANNING -- The hall is dark and empty.  Suddenly, a 
VISION of Andy in his room FADES IN over the dark hallway.

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Nah, just a dark hallway and...  
Wait, wait...!  I see Andy!

The other Toys look at each other, disbelieving.

What?!

JESSIE

That’s impossible...!

MR. POTATO HEAD

MRS. POTATO HEAD

No, I really see him!  In his room!  
My other eye!  The one I left behind!  

(realizing)

She concentrates fiercely.  

TRANSITION TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - NIGHT - POV
From under the bed, we SEE college boxes piled up by the 
open door.  Andy crosses frame, carrying another box.

MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O)
This is so weird...!  He’s packing 
up... Uh-oh.  Oh, here comes Buster.

Buster sniffs under the bed, right toward her eye.

Outta the way!  Get away!  

MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O.) 

              64

Buster yawns, turns, and walks out of FRAME.

MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O.)
Okay, Andy’s in the hall.  He’s 
looking in the attic.  Wait, there’s 
Mom.  Why is he so upset?

Andy gestures -- I left the Toys right here!  Mom shrugs.  
Andy picks up a trash bag.  Then Andy’s Mom remembers -- 
her hands fly to her face.  Andy slaps his forehead. 

Oh, no!  Oh, this is terrible!

MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O.)

TRANSITION BACK:

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
Mrs. Potato Head puts her eye back in, looks at the others.  

MRS. POTATO HEAD 

He’s looking for us!  Andy’s looking 
for us!

JESSIE 
He’s looking for us?!

REX
So, Andy does want us!  I knew it!  I 
just knew it!!!  

Rex picks up an Alien, does a happy dance. 

MRS. POTATO HEAD 

I think he did mean to put us in the 
attic!

Well, then Woody was telling the truth!

SLINKY

Holy cow!

MR. POTATO HEAD

HAMM

And you didn’t believe him!
MR. POTATO HEAD

Hey, you didn’t believe him first!

Jessie stands -- fire in her eyes.

Guys, we gotta...  We gotta go home!

JESSIE

              65

CREAK -- A door opens.  Light spills in.  The Toys turn.
Lotso saunters in with his Gang. 

Lotso...! 

JESSIE 

How’re y’all doin’ this fine evening?

LOTSO

JESSIE
Oh, thank heavens!  

Jessie rushes to him.  The others follow.

Have you seen Buzz?  

JESSIE (CONT'D)

MRS. POTATO HEAD

There’s been a mistake!  We have to 
go!

LOTSO 

Go?!  Why, you just got here!  In the 
nick of time, too!  We were runnin’ 
low on volunteers for the Little 
Ones!  They just love new Toys, now 
don’t they?

MR. POTATO HEAD

Love?!  We’ve been chewed!  Kicked!  
Drooled on!

MRS. POTATO HEAD
Just look at my pocketbook!  

She holds up her chewed purse.  Lotso bends down, amused.

LOTSO 

Well, here’s the thing, Sweet Potato  
-- you ain’t leavin’ Sunnyside.

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Sweet Potato?!  Who do you think 
you’re talking to?  I have over 
thirty accessories and I deserve more 
respec--

Abruptly, Lotso yanks her mouth off.  Everyone is shocked.  

Ahh...!  That’s better!

LOTSO

Lotso’s Henchmen snicker.  

              66

MR. POTATO HEAD

Hey!  No one takes my wife’s mouth!!!  
Except me!  Give it back, you furry 
air freshener!

He steps up to retrieve the mouth.  Lotso holds it above 
him.  He finally grabs it.  Jessie heads for the door.

C’mon, guys -- we’re going home.

JESSIE

LOTSO

Whoa, Missy!  You’re not going 
anywhere.

JESSIE

(over her shoulder)

Oh, yeah?  And who’s gonna stop us?

Jessie almost collides with a blank-faced Buzz, stepping 
from the shadows.  Jessie and the others are thrilled.

Buzz!  You’re back!

REX

He runs -- arms open -- to greet him.  Buzz makes a Kung-Fu  
sound, strikes a pose. 

Buzz...?  

REX (CONT'D)

WHAM!!!  Buzz tackles Rex, slamming him to the floor.  

Hey!

JESSIE

Buzz leaps and kicks, spins the Toys around, and knocks 
their legs from under them.  

Buzz!

SLINKY

The Toys fall to the floor, stunned.  Buzz stands atop 
them, salutes.

Prisoners disabled, Commander Lotso!

BUZZ

Buzz?  What are you doing...?

JESSIE

BUZZ

Silence, minions of Zurg!  You’re in 
the custody of the Galactic Alliance!

              67

Zurg...?

REX

Galactic Alliance...?

MR. POTATO HEAD

Huh-boy...!

HAMM

Good work, Lightyear.  Now lock ‘em up!

LOTSO

Yes, sir!  

BUZZ

JUMP CUTS -- Buzz and Lotso’s Gang herd the Toys into the 
room’s wire-mesh cubbies.  
Jessie fights back -- taking out Chunk and Sparks.  Stretch 
grabs her from behind, puts her in a wire cubby, shuts it.  

Where do you think you’re going?!

STRETCH

Jessie reaches through the cubby wire to Buzz’s shoulder.

Buzz...?!  We’re your friends!

JESSIE

He swats her hand away.

BUZZ 

Spare me your lies, Temptress!  Your 
Emperor is defeated.  And I’m immune 
to your...  Bewitching good looks.

He turns, ramrod straight, and walks off.  
Big Baby lifts Mrs. Potato Head to a cubby.  Mr. Potato 
Head intercedes.

MR. POTATO HEAD 

Hey, Mongo!  Keep your paws off my 
wife!

Big Baby drops Mrs. Potato Head in the cubby, turns and 
picks up Mr. Potato Head.

MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
Hey, what are you doing?  Let go of 
me you drooling doofus!

Lotso steps in.

              68

 LOTSO 

Wait!  I think this Potato needs to 
learn himself some manners!  Take him 
to The Box.  

Big Baby hoists Potato Head up and toddles off.  

MR. POTATO HEAD 

Where’re you taking me?  Put me down, 
you moron!  Bad baby!  Bad baby!!!

They toddle past Barbie as she enters the room, confused.

Ken...?!  What’s going on?!

BARBIE 

KEN
Barbie...!  I told you to wait in 
the Dream House!

Ken puts an arm around her, leading her out.

What’re you doing to my friends?

BARBIE

Barbie looks over her shoulder as Sparks the Robot tosses 
an Alien into a cubby.  Twitch slams it shut.  

Hmmph!

BARBIE (CONT'D)

She slaps Ken’s arm away and turns to join the Toys in 
solidarity.  Ken tries to grab her.

Wait, Barbie!  

KEN 

Don’t touch me!  We’re through!

BARBIE 

She stalks off.  Ken is devastated.  Then Barbie turns, 
walks back to him.  He smiles.

And gimme my scarf back!

BARBIE (CONT'D)

She yanks the ascot off his neck.

Oww!

KEN

Barbie is slammed into a cubby.  Lotso surveys the room.

              69

LOTSO

Lightyear!  Explain our overnight 
accommodations.

Yes, sir!

BUZZ

Buzz strides past the Toys, each trapped in a cubby.

BUZZ (CONT'D)

Prisoners sleep in their cells!  Any 
Prisoner caught outside their cell 
spends the night in The Box!  

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
Potato Head is carried to a covered sandbox.  Big Baby 
lifts the sandbox cover, tosses Potato Head in.  Potato 
Head reaches out, begging for mercy...

BUZZ (O.S.)

Roll call at dusk and dawn!  Any 
Prisoner misses roll call spends the 
night in The Box!

...Big Baby lowers the lid, closing into BLACKNESS.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
Buzz rattles off the rules.  Jessie grows impatient.

BUZZ

Prisoners do not speak unless spoken 
to!  Any Prisoner talks back spends 
the night...  

...In The Box.  We get it.  

JESSIE

Buzz whips around.  Lotso puts a calming hand on him.

LOTSO

At ease, soldier!  They’re 
neutralized!  But remember:  They’ll 
say anything to make you doubt 
yourself!

BUZZ

Don’t worry, Commander!  Any doubt I 
had got pounded out of me at the 
Academy!

Lotso climbs on a podium of ABC blocks -- jovial, relaxed.

              70

LOTSO 

Listen up, folks!  We got a way of 
doing things here at Sunnyside!  If 
you start at the bottom, pay your 
dues...  Life here can be a dream 
come true!  But if you break our 
rules, step outta line, try to check 
out early?  Well...  You’re just 
hurtin’ yourselves.

He takes out Woody’s hat, tosses it.  It slides across the 
floor to Jessie’s cubby.  The Toys gasp in horror. 

JESSIE

Woody...!  
What’d you do to him?!

(to Lotso)

Lotso sits back in his truck bed, taps his cane.

LOTSO 

Y’all get a good night’s rest!  You 
got a full day of play time tomorrow. 

Lotso chuckles as he and his cronies drive off.  Buzz 
remains behind, standing guard over the “cell block”.
The Toys grasp the bars of their cubbies -- the horrible 
truth of their situation hitting home.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
CLOSE ON -- A computer keyboard.  Woody types an address.

1-2-2-5...  Sy--ca--more...

WOODY

BLOOP -- Suddenly, an IM WINDOW pops up on the SCREEN.

Who’s “VelociSTAR237”?

WOODY (CONT'D)

Trixie pushes in.

TRIXIE

Oh...! That’s just a dinosaur toy 
down the street.  That’s nothing. 
Lemme just take care of that!  
Just a dinosaur...!

(beat)

Woody finishes typing.

              71

WOODY

All right.  Sy--ca--more... Okay, 
“Enter”!

Trixie hits the Return.  Slowly, a map begins to assemble.  

Please don’t be far!  Please!

WOODY (CONT'D)

The map resolves itself.  The route to Andy’s house is a 
short “Z” -- less than two blocks away.  Woody is amazed.

WOODY (CONT'D)
Right around the corner...?!  It’s 
right around the corner!!!

Ecstatic, he hugs Bonnie’s toys, leaps off the desk, does a 
happy dance across the floor, strides to the kitchen door.

WOODY (CONT'D)

I’m going to college!  Look at me, 
I’m big toy on campus!  Hello!  Hey!  
I’ll see you at the Sock Hop!

Okay, Potsie!

DOLLY

Woody starts to slip through a pet door.

WOODY 

Oh, hey, listen -- if any of you guys 
ever get to Sunnyside Day Care?  You  
tell ‘em Woody made it home!

Bonnie’s Toys gasp.

You came from Sunnyside?! 

DOLLY

But...  How’d you escape?!!!

TRIXIE

WOODY

It wasn’t easy, I...  What do you 
mean “escape”?

Bonnie’s Toys trade glances.  Pricklepants steps forward.  

MR. PRICKLEPANTS

Sunnyside is a place of ruin and 
despair, ruled by an evil bear who 
smells of strawberries!  

Lotso...?!  

WOODY

              72

BUTTERCUP

He may seem plush and huggable on the 
outside.  But inside, he’s a monster!

WOODY

But...  How do you know that? 
MR. PRICKLEPANTS
Chuckles...  He’ll tell you!

They turn -- with awe and respect -- to a toy clown, 
Chuckles, sitting on a sill, staring grimly out the window.  
Woody steps forward.

CHUCKLES

Yeah, I knew Lotso.  He was a good 
toy.  A friend.  Me and him, we had 
the same kid -- Daisy... 

INT. DAISY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
A freckle-faced five-year-old, DAISY, unwraps a gift under 
a Christmas tree and finds a fresh, smiling Lotso inside.  

I was there when Lotso got unwrapped.

CHUCKLES (V.O.)

She hugs him -- love at first sight. 

CHUCKLES (V.O.)

Daisy loved us all, but Lotso...  
Lotso was special.

INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACKS
QUICK CUTS: Daisy takes Lotso everywhere -- jumping through 
a lawn sprinkler; pushed on a swing; in bed while she reads 
to him, etc.  He gazes lovingly at her.

 CHUCKLES (V.O.) 

They did everything together.  You 
never seen a kid and a toy more in 
love.

EXT. STATION WAGON - DAY - FLASHBACK
Daisy sits in the back of a station wagon, Lotso in her 
lap.  Big Baby and Chuckles are buckled in beside them. 

CHUCKLES (V.O.)
One day, we took a drive...

              73

EXT. REST STOP - DAY - FLASHBACK
At a rest stop, Daisy’s Family has lunch in the grass while 
Daisy plays happily with Lotso, Chuckles, and Big Baby.

CHUCKLES (V.O.)

Hit a rest stop, had a little play 
time. 

Daisy’s Mom waves a sandwich.  Daisy puts down the Toys and 
runs to join her family.

DISSOLVE TO:

A sleeping Daisy is carried to the car.

After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

CHUCKLES (V.O.) (CONT'D)

A seat belt is clicked around the sleeping Daisy.  The car 
drives off.
Daisy’s Toys sit up, their worst fears come true.

DISSOLVES:
Lotso peers down the road, keeping vigil as the sun sets.  
Days pass.  Rain falls.  The forgotten Toys remain.

She never came back.

CHUCKLES  (V.O.) (CONT'D)

CLOSE -- A heart-shaped pendant reads, “My heart belongs 
to...”   A child’s writing shows Daisy’s name and address.
Lotso reads the pendant, hung around Big Baby’s neck.  He 
sets off across the fields.  Chuckles and Big Baby follow.

CHUCKLES  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Lotso wouldn’t give up.  It took 
forever, but we finally made it back 
to Daisy’s.    

EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE - DUSK
Lotso, Chuckles and Big Baby stand in the bushes outside 
Daisy’s window -- muddy, worn.  Big Baby boosts Lotso and 
Chuckles to the window sill.  They peer in.  Through the 
window, Daisy lies in her bed, reading a picture book.

CHUCKLES (V.O.)
But by then, it was too late.

FAST ZOOM -- Tucked beside her is a brand-new Lotso Bear.

              74

TRACK IN ON -- Lotso.  His Universe is shattered.  
Lotso drops from the window.  Rain begins to fall. 

CHUCKLES (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Something changed that day inside 
Lotso.  Something snapped... 

Lotso’s face hardens.  Big Baby stares -- uncomprehending.  

She replaced us.  C’mon!

LOTSO

He turns to go, but Big Baby and Chuckles stay put.

YOUNG CHUCKLES
No, she only replaced yo--!

Lotso turns on Chuckles.

She replaced all of us!  Didn’t she?!

LOTSO

Chuckles shrinks back, cowed.  Big Baby looks at the 
pendant, turns and begins climbing up towards Daisy’s 
window.  Lotso walks back to Big Baby and yanks him down.

LOTSO (CONT'D)

She don’t love you no more!  Now 
come on!

He rips the pendant off, throws it away, and stalks off.  
Chuckles and Big Baby are left behind -- heart-broken.

EXT. TRUCK BUMPER - NIGHT
Lotso, Chuckles, and Big Baby hunch in the red, tail-lit 
glow of the bumper of a delivery truck as it drives through 
swirling rain.  Their eyes are dead, hopeless.

CHUCKLES (V.O.)

We were lost.  Cast off.  Unloved. 
Unwanted...

The truck hits a pothole, knocking them off the bumper.  
They hit the pavement, tumble into a puddle in front of...

EXT. SUNNYSIDE DAY CARE, FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
It’s dark.  Rain pours.  Lotso, Chuckles, and the Baby lift 
their faces from the puddle.  
A FLASH of lightning reveals the Sunnyside Day Care Center. 

              75

CHUCKLES 

Then we found Sunnyside.  But Lotso 
wasn’t my friend anymore...

Lotso stands, eyes narrowed.  He limps towards the Day 
Care.  Chuckles and Big Baby watch from the puddle.  
Lightning FLASHES.

MATCH CUT:

INT. KITCHEN - DAWN
Chuckles, remembering.  Woody listens, rapt.  

CHUCKLES

...He wasn’t anyone’s friend.  He 
took over Sunnyside, rigged the whole 
system.

He reaches in his pocket, pulls out Big Baby’s pendant. 

So...  How’d you get out?

WOODY

CHUCKLES

I got broke.  Bonnie found me, took 
me home.  Other Toys, they weren’t so 
lucky.
It ain’t right, what Lotso done!  New 
toys -- they don’t stand a chance!  

(voice quavers)

Woody looks up.

But...  My friends are in there!

WOODY

BUTTERCUP

You can’t go back!  It’s too 
dangerous!

Returning now would be suicide!

MR. PRICKLEPANTS

But what about your... “Andy”?

DOLLY

Isn’t he leaving tomorrow? 

TRIXIE

TRACK IN ON -- Woody, torn. 

              76

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAWN
The room is still.  A HARMONICA plays mournfully.  
TRACK down the cubbies -- The Toys grip the bars, forlorn. 
CRANE TO REVEAL Hamm, playing the harmonica.  
Suddenly, Buzz pounds on Hamm’s cubby.

Quiet, musical hog!  Knock it off!

BUZZ

Hamm stops playing, sighs.  Buzz moves off.  Bullseye looks 
at Woody’s hat, whimpers sadly.  Jessie pats his muzzle.

Oh, Bullseye...  I miss Woody, too. 

JESSIE

She turns away, bows her head.

But he ain’t ever comin’ back.  

JESSIE (CONT'D)

Jessie lifts her boot, revealing “ANDY” written underneath.  
Her eyes fill with regret.  
The bathroom door bursts open.  A Tonka truck races in the 
room -- Lotso in the back, his Gang hanging off the sides, 
WHOOPING it up.  The truck comes screeching to a stop.

Rise and shine, Campers!  

LOTSO

Buzz snaps to attention, salutes.

BUZZ
Commander Lotso, Sir!  All quiet!  
Nothing to report!
LOTSO 

Excellent, Lightyear!  C’mon -- we 
need you back at Star Command!

Buzz hops in the back of the truck.  

MRS. POTATO HEAD

Wait!  What you have you done with my 
husband?!

Big Baby...?

LOTSO

Big Baby steps forward and tosses a dazed Mr. Potato Head 
into the room -- coughing, groaning, covered in sand.   

              77

The Toys gasp.  Mrs. Potato Head reaches out.

Sweetheart...!

MRS. POTATO HEAD 

MR. POTATO HEAD

It was cold...!  And dark...!  
Nothing but sand and a couple of 
Lincoln Logs...

HAMM 

I don’t think those weren’t Lincoln 
Logs.

Lotso addresses the room.

LOTSO 
Y’all get ready -- you got a play-
date with destiny!

CUT TO:

A BELL -- Ringing.  
Bonnie runs down the hall and enters the Butterfly Room.

INT. BUTTERFLY ROOM - DAY
The room thrums with the happy CHATTER of young kids.  
Bonnie drops off her backpack at the lockers, rushes off.  
STAY on her backpack.  It unzips.  Woody peers out, then 
surreptitiously scrambles to the top of a bookshelf. 

INT. CEILING CRAWL SPACE, BUTTERFLY ROOM - DAY
Woody pushes aside an acoustic panel, climbs in the crawl 
space above the tiles, and slides the panel back in place.  
O.S. -- Children’s SHRIEKS.  Woody turns.

INT. CEILING CRAWL SPACE, CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY
Crawling, Woody follows the noise, puts his ear to a tile.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY
Woody pulls up the ceiling tile and drops onto an empty 
reading loft, furnished with pillows and bean bag chairs.  
He creeps to the edge of the loft and scans the room.

              78

POV -- Below, a Toddler uses Rex to hammer a bongo drum.  
Another Toddler holds a Potato Head in each hand, then 
smashes them to the ground.  Their pieces scatter.
A child swings Jessie by her hair, releases her.  Jessie 
slams into a wall, drops to the floor.
Woody is horrified.  
Then, off-screen, a toy-phone bell RINGS. 
Woody turns.  A Fisher Price Phone, The Lifer, wheels into 
view.  He RINGS again, drops his receiver, retreats into 
shadows.  Woody creeps to the phone, lifts the receiver.  

Uh...  Hello...?

WOODY

The Lifer’s voice is hoarse and grizzled.  

LIFER

You shouldn’a come back, Cowboy.  
They cracked down hard since you 
left.  More guards.  More patrols.  
You and your friends ain’t ever 
gettin’ outta here now.

I made it out once...

WOODY 

LIFER 

You got lucky once.  Want my advice?  
Keep your heads down.  You’ll survive.  

Yeah?  For how long?

WOODY

LIFER

(squints like Clint)

I been here years.  They’ll never 
break me.  There’s only one way Toys 
leave this place...

The Lifer rolls forward.  Through the window, the Janitor -- 
across the yard -- dumps the broken Toy Train into a trash 
chute.  Woody shudders -- he’s just witnessed a Toy death.  

LIFER (CONT'D)

Poor fella.  Trash truck comes at 
dawn.  Then it’s off to The Dump...

Woody bends down, respectful.

              79

WOODY 

I appreciate your concern, Old Timer.  
But we have a kid waiting for us.  
Now we’re leaving.  If you’d help us  
-- one toy to another -- I’d sure be 
grateful.

The Lifer sighs.

LIFER

Well, if you’re gonna get out...  
First thing you gotta get through’s 
the doors.

SHOTS -- FAST TRACKING IN on knobs of the playground door; 
the hall door; the office door.  Each door is shut and 
locked.  Keys are left dangling on a hook in the office.

LIFER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...Locked every night, inside and 
out.  Keys are left on a hook in the 
office.  

Got it.  What else?

WOODY (V.O.)

SHOTS -- Night.  Toy Trucks patrol the empty halls of the 
Day Care.  Outside, Trucks patrol the deserted playground.

LIFER  (V.O.)

Lotso has trucks patrolling all night 
long.  Hallway.  Lobby.  Playground.  

Yeah, yeah...  What about the wall?

WOODY

SHOTS -- TRACKING along the mural-covered cinder block wall.  

LIFER (V.O.) 

Eight feet high.  Cinderblock.  No 
way through it.  You go over or 
under.

Woody frowns.

That’s it?!   Doesn’t seem so bad.

WOODY

LIFER

It’s not.  Your real problem’s The 
Monkey.

              80

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
A TOY CHIMP sits at the console of security monitors.

The Monkey’s the Eye in the Sky...

LIFER (V.O.) 

CLOSE ON -- THE MONKEY’S EYES 
The bank of monitors is reflected in them.

He sees everything... 

LIFER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
A Toy Bunny slips through the bars of his cubby, scampers 
toward the hallway door.

...Classrooms...

LIFER (V.O.)

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
The Monkey, staring at the security monitors, sees the 
Bunny on screen, bares his teeth and SCREECHES, presses the 
PA button, and begins furiously banging his cymbals.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
The Bunny -- busted -- freezes and looks around in a panic.  
The hall door opens and Lotso and his Gang step in.  Big 
Baby lurches toward the Bunny menacingly.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
A Patrol Truck passes down a dark hallway.  A Toy Penguin, 
hidden, peeks out of a potted plant, jumps to the floor. 

...Hallways...

LIFER (V.O.)

He waddles for the front door.
ZOOM UP to a security camera at the end of the hall.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
The Monkey sees the Penguin, hits the PA button, and begins 
SCREECHING and banging cymbals.

              81

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
The Penguin is surrounded by Patrol Trucks.  He puts his 
wings up.  Big Baby pushes his way through the trucks, 
intent on meting out prompt and thorough justice.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
A trio of Plushies use a dart gun to fire a dart, tied with 
string, over the wall.  They begin scaling the wall.

...Even the playground.

LIFER

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
The Monkey sees the Plushies, SCREECHES his alarm.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
A spotlight hits the Plushies.  Within the spotlight rises 
the silhouette of Big Baby, arms lifted.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY
The Lifer lays it on the line for Woody.

LIFER

You can unlock doors, sneak past 
guards, climb the wall...  But if you 
don’t take out that Monkey, you ain’t 
goin’ nowhere.  Y’wanna get outta 
here?  Get ridda that Monkey!

SMASH TO:

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY
A bell RINGS.  The Toddlers -- playing rough -- look up.

Okay!  Recess! 

TEACHER

She opens the playground door.  The Toddlers drop the Toys, 
rush outside. The Teacher hits the lights, closes the door.  
Jessie and the Toys sit up, groaning and aching.

Pssst...!  Pssst...!  Hey, guys...!

WOODY (O.S.)

They look over.  From a puppet theater, Woody waves.  

              82

JESSIE

They quickly run and gather around him, rejoicing.

You’re alive!!!

Hey, Buddy!

‘Course I’m alive...!

Hey, my hat!!!

Woody takes his hat from Bullseye, puts it on.

Wait.  Where’s Buzz?

WOODY (CONT'D)

Lotso did something to him!  

REX

He thinks he’s a Space Ranger again!

SLINKY

Oh no...

WOODY

Oh yes.  “Return of the Astro Nut!”  

HAMM

JESSIE 

Oh, Woody, we were wrong to leave 
Andy.  I...  I was wrong...
MR. POTATO HEAD

Jessie’s right, Woody -- she was 
wrong!

WOODY

No, no.  It’s my fault for leaving 
you guys.  From now on, we stick 
together. 

The Toys smile, reassured.

              83

But...  Andy’s leavin’ for college!

SLINKY

JESSIE

College!!!  Hog-tie the mailman!!!  
We gotta get you home before Andy 
leaves tomorrow!
HAMM

Tomorrow...?  But, that means...

WOODY

It means we’re busting outta here 
tonight.

What?!  Impossible!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

But there’s no way outta here!

REX

No, there is one way out.  One way...

WOODY

He turns.  
RACK FOCUS -- Through the window is the trash chute on the 
maintenance shed.  Woody turns to the Toys.  They huddle.

Okay, here’s the plan...

Silence.  Buzz backs up, looks in the cubby. 

Hey!  Tuberous Root Man!  Wake up!

BUZZ

Buzz rattles the bars.  An actual potato rolls to the front 
of the cubby -- a dummy potato, as it were.  

Impossible!

BUZZ (CONT'D)

A NOISE.  Ken and Buzz turn.  
Potato Head is at the window, struggling with the locks.  

Hey!

BUZZ (CONT'D)

Potato Head sees he’s been spotted.  He jumps off the sill 
and sprints to the bathroom door.  
Buzz and Ken run across the room.  Big Baby toddles after 
them.  As they EXIT FRAME we TILT UP to find...
Woody, in a hanging light, takes out a pipe cleaner, bends 
it, uses it to snag the clothing line of kids’ paintings.
Potato Head reaches the bathroom, bangs on the door, then 
turns to face Buzz, Ken, and Big Baby.  They surround him.

INT. FRONT OFFICE - NIGHT
The Monkey, at the security console, sees Buzz and Ken 
corner Potato Head.  He leans in to watch.

KEN

Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato 
Head?

MR. POTATO HEAD

That’s Mr. Potato Head to you, 
Smoothie!

PAN and ZOOM past the distracted Monkey to another monitor.  
On it, Slinky slips out of his cubby cell.

KEN (O.S.)

You’re turning out to be quite the 
trouble-maker, aren’t ya?

INT. CATERPILLAR CLASSROOM - NIGHT
Behind Ken and Buzz, Slinky runs to the middle of the room. 

KEN (O.C.)
What’d you think you were gonna do?  
Waltz right outta here?

Woody grabs a bag of marbles, grasps the clothesline, jumps.

MR. POTATO HEAD (O.C.)
And I would’a got away with it too, 
if it weren’t for you meddling Toys!

Woody lowers via the clothesline, drops the bag of marbles, 
grabs Slinky, and ascends back up to the ceiling. 

MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

Ya ascot-wearin’ pink-noser!  Mr. 
Brains-Sold-Separately!!! 

He kicks Ken.  Ken yelps, turns to Big Baby.

Take him back to The Box!

KEN

Big Baby grabs Potato Head, lifts him off the ground. 

MR. POTATO HEAD 

No!  Not The Box!  I’m sorry!  I 
didn’t mean it!  I like ascots!  
Really!  No...  No!  Noooooo!!!

They disappear through the bathroom door.

              86

INT. CEILING CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT
Woody and Slinky watch as Potato Head is dragged off.  They 
close the ceiling panel. 

Okay, check...

INT. CATERPILLAR CLASSROOM - NIGHT
Ken turns to Buzz.

KEN

Good work, Lightyear!  Resume your, 
uh...  Space-guy...  Thing-y!

Yes, sir, Well-Groomed Man!

BUZZ

He salutes, departs.  Ken turns to go.  

Ken...?!  Ken...!

BARBIE (O.C.)

Ken stops.  Barbie waves to him.  Ken looks around, then 
approaches warily.  Barbie is tearful.

KEN
What do you want?

BARBIE

I can’t take it here, Ken!  I want to 
go to the Butterfly Room!  With you!

KEN
Yeah, well, you should’a thought of 
that yesterday.

BARBIE

I was wrong!  I want to be with you, 
Ken!  In your Dream House!  Take me 
away from this!  Take me away!

She breaks down sobbing.  Ken is torn.  Finally, he gives 
in -- no match for a woman’s tears.  

Darn it, Barbie...!

KEN

He moves closer, speaks low.

KEN (CONT'D)

Okay, but, things are complicated 
around here. You gotta do what I say!

              87

BARBIE

(tears of gratitude)

I will, Ken!  I promise!

Satisfied -- and a little smug -- he pulls open the cubby.

INT. SANDBOX - NIGHT
Big Baby opens the lid of the Sand Box.  

MR. POTATO HEAD

Wait!  I’ll do anything...!  I’ll 
change your diapers!  

Big Baby tosses Potato Head in, lowers the lid.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
Big Baby turns and walks off.  STAY ON the sand box.
TRACK IN to find a wood knot in the side of the box.  
It pops out, falls to the ground.  Potato Head’s hand 
emerges, clutching his eye.  It looks around.
One by one, Mr. Potato Head’s parts fly out the hole and 
land on the ground, next to the sandbox.

INT. FRONT OFFICE - NIGHT
The Monkey sits motionless, staring maniacally at the 
security monitors.  The only sound is a TICKING clock.   
Woody, clutching a pouch, drops into FRAME behind the Monkey 
as Slinky, holding Woody’s ankles, lowers Woody head-first.  
Woody -- dangling -- begins swinging closer and closer to 
the Monkey.  
The Monkey frowns at a reflection in the monitor.  
The Monkey whips around, SCREECHING.  Slinky slips.  He and 
Woody land on the Monkey, knocking the mic to the ground.  
The Monkey HISSES, leaps off the desk, runs for the mic.  
Woody lunges for the Monkey, but misses.  He grabs the 
microphone cord and whips it, tripping the Monkey.
Woody grabs the Monkey.  The Monkey flips himself on top of 
Woody and starts crashing his cymbals against Woody’s head.

              88

Go...  Get...  The...  Tape!!!

WOODY 

Slinky runs to a Scotch tape dispenser, grabs the tape with 
his teeth, heads back toward Woody.  The Monkey turns, sees 
Slinky charging, tape in his mouth.  He SCREECHES.

CUT TO BLACK

INT. KEN’S DREAM HOUSE, BUTTERFLY ROOM - NIGHT
Ken and Barbie ride the Dream House elevator to the top 
floor.  Ken opens the door.
KEN

And this... Is where the magic 
happens.

FAST PULL BACK to REVEAL the living room of his Dream 
House.  Racks of clothes line the walls.  Barbie gasps.

BARBIE

Look at all your clothes!!!  I can’t 
believe you never brought me up here!

Barbie flips through the racks.  Ken joins her.

Tennis whites!  Mission to Mars!

BARBIE (CONT'D)

KEN

I know, I know!  Check this out -- 
“Kung-Fu Fighting”!  “Campus Hero” 
with matching sports pennant, huh?!

Flower Power...!!!  Oh, Ken...!

BARBIE

Ken pivots away, his mood turning to melancholy reflection.

KEN

No one appreciates clothes here, 
Barbie.  
No one.

(then, bitter:)

Barbie walks up behind him.

BARBIE
Ken...  Would you model a few outfits 
for me?  Just a few?

Ken is stunned -- no one’s ever asked this of him.  
Throbbing DISCO begins.  

              89

FASHION MONTAGE -- QUICK CUTS
Ken emerges from behind a screen, sporting some of the most 
insane Ken outfits ever -- ‘90s, ‘80s, ‘70s, even 1960s -- 
with matching accessories.
Ken strikes just the right pose for each outfit -- slinging 
a jacket over his shoulder; doing “The Frug” in a fringe 
vest; polka-ing in Lederhosen; scuba moves; break dancing.
Barbie sits watching, enthralled.  She laughs, claws her 
hand, growls like a cat.  Finally, she applauds wildly.
Ken grins -- exceptionally pleased with himself.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
Woody and Slinky finish taping up the struggling Monkey. 
Slinky opens a desk drawer.  Woody rolls the Monkey in.  
Slinky pushes it closed.

Go get the key!

SLINKY

Woody runs to a bulletin board above the desk.  

WOODY

Where is it...?   Where is it...?  
Where’s the key?

He finds the keys, buried under push-pinned papers.

Bingo!

WOODY (CONT'D)

Slinky toggles a security camera joystick.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
Jessie sees the security camera panning back and forth.  
She turns, whispers.

Yodel-Lay-Hee-Hoooooo...!!!

JESSIE 

A few cubbies down, Hamm and Rex share a look.  
ANGLE -- Buzz, patrolling...

Hey!  Whadda you think you’re doin?!

HAMM (O.S.)

Buzz stops, turns.

              90

In the cell, Hamm plugs his cork into his belly.

HAMM

I told you -- keep your hands off of 
my stuff!

Rex raises his fists, trying to sound tough.

Make a move, Porky!  

REX 

Hamm jumps Rex.  They grapple.  Buzz runs over.  

Hey!  No fighting!  Break it up!  

BUZZ

He pulls the “cell” from the cubby and they tumble out.   

HAMM

Take that, Walnut-Brain!  No wonder 
you’re extinct!

Jessie and Bullseye steal out of their cubbies while Buzz 
gets between Hamm and Rex, holding them apart. 

BUZZ 

Hey, you can’t hit each other!  
That’s my job!

Yoo-hoo!

JESSIE (O.C.)

Buzz looks up.  Jessie and Bullseye stand on a bookcase 
above him, holding an empty, clear plastic toy bin.  
They leap, slamming the bin over Buzz.  Hamm and Rex leap 
on top of it, pinning it to the floor. 

BUZZ 
Help!  Prison riot!

(muffled)

Buzz FIRES his laser in a circle at the side of the bin.  
He charges at the wall, hits it, and falls over.
Jessie turns to Bullseye.

Get the tortilla!

JESSIE

Bullseye heads to a locker, pulls out a lunch box.  Jessie 
opens it.  Inside is a tortilla.  Jessie grabs it, dashes 
to the door, slides it under.  She knocks and runs off.

              91

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
The tortilla lays outside.  From the shadows, one of Potato 
Head’s arms appears, crawls over, grabs the tortilla, and 
drags it into the darkness.  One by one, the parts implant 
themselves in the tortilla. The Tortilla stands unsteadily, 
looks around, blinks, then heads off across the playground.  

INT.  KEN’S DREAM HOUSE, BUTTERFLY ROOM - NIGHT
Ken -- headband on -- is behind a shoji screen.

Ready?

Ready...!

KEN

BARBIE (O.C.)

Ken leaps from behind the screen in a Karate Gi and does a 
series of fighting moves, kicking and punching the air.

Haiii-Yaaa!  Wah!  Whaaa-aaa-aaa --

KEN

He freezes mid-pose.  Barbie isn’t there.

Uh... Barbie?

KEN (CONT'D)

Barbie leaps out of nowhere, tackling Ken.  Ken lands on 
his chest.  Barbie grabs his head, spins it 180 degrees.

BARBIE

No more games, Ken. What did Lotso do 
to Buzz, and how do we get him back? 

Ken is secretly thrilled to have Barbie straddling his 
chest, talking tough.  He is defiant.

You can’t make me talk!  You can’t!

KEN 

Barbie glares at him, eyes narrowing. 
Ken -- unable to contain his excitement -- blurts out:

...But I’d like to see you try!!!

KEN (CONT'D)

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
A Security truck patrols the hall.  As it passes, the 
office door opens.  Woody peers out.

              92

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
Slinky is poised with a key attached to a rubber-band sling 
shot.  Slinky pulls it back.  Woody signals “Go!”
Slinky releases the slingshot.  It shoots the key under the 
door, across the hall and into the Caterpillar Room.  

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
Jessie stops the key with her boot, picks it up.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
Mr. Potato Head hoists himself up a tricycle and onto a 
classroom window ledge.  He peers in.
Inside the Butterfly Room, Lotso is asleep.  Potato Head 
turns and uses the trike’s mirror to catch a moonbeam.  

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
Mrs. Potato Head, on the sill by the door, sees the signal.  
She uses the key to unlock the door.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
The door opens.  Jessie, Bullseye, Mrs. Potato Head and the 
Aliens slip outside.  As a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past, they duck 
behind a traffic cone then creep off across the playground.  

INT. KEN’S DREAM HOUSE, BUTTERFLY ROOM - NIGHT
Ken is tied to a paddle-ball paddle by the ball’s string.  
He glowers as Barbie browses through his racks of clothing.

Let’s see -- Hawaiian surf trunks...

BARBIE

She holds them up, then RIPS them apart.  Ken is horrified.

KEN

Barbie, those were vintage!
(steels himself)
It’s okay!  Go ahead, rip ‘em!  
They’re a dime a dozen!

BARBIE  
Oooohh!  Glitter tux!

              93

RIPPPP...!  She tosses the shreds at him.  Ken groans in 
torment, but remains defiant.

KEN

Who cares?!  Who cares?!  Sequins are 
tacky! 

Barbie picks up a Nehru jacket.  Ken gasps in horror.

Oooohh!!  A Nehru jacket!

BARBIE 

Barbie!!!  Not the Nehru...!

KEN

This is from, what -- 1967?  

BARBIE

The Gruvvy Formal Collection, yes!  

KEN

BARBIE

What a shame...
KEN

Oh, no!  No!  No, no, no...!!!

Barbie pulls at the seams.  A stitch POPS.  Ken cracks.

KEN (CONT'D)

There’s an instruction manual!  Lotso 
switched Buzz to Demo Mode...!

He breaks down, sobbing.  Barbie, steely, grabs Ken.

BARBIE
Where’s that manual?

INT. UTILITY CLOSET - NIGHT
A sleepy Bookworm pulls the Buzz Lightyear Manual from his 
stacks, hands it down to a waiting Figure in a SPACE SUIT.

BOOKWORM

I don’t know why this can’t wait til 
morning, Ken, but...  Here ya go!

The Figure salutes, turns, walks off.  The Bookworm turns 
away, then hears an odd CLICKING.  He turns back, stares. 
POV -- The Space-Suited Figure is wearing pink high heels.
The Bookworm rolls his eyes -- Ken! -- and turns away.

INT. CLASSROOM CEILING CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT

What’s takin’ so doggone long?

SLINKY

A KNOCK.  Woody slides the ceiling panel, revealing Barbie 
in the Space Suit, helmet off.
WOODY

So how do we fix Buzz?

Barbie grins, hoists up Buzz’s Instruction Manual.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
Potato Head, on the ledge, sees Barbie pulled up into the 
ceiling.  

INT. CLASSROOM CEILING CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT
Woody gives Potato Head the “thumbs up”.  Potato Head 
responds with complicated baseball-catcher gestures.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
Potato Head turns and edges down the ledge.  A FLUTTERING.  
He looks.  His path is blocked by a Pigeon.  A stare down.

What’re you lookin’ at, Feathers?

MR. POTATO HEAD

The pigeon pecks him, taking a chunk out of his tortilla. 

Hey!  Ow!

MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

The pigeon pecks again.  Potato Head slaps the pigeon.  The 
pigeon grabs his forehead, dragging him down the ledge.   
Potato Head hits the pigeon with his hat, gives it a kick.  
The pigeon flies off.  Potato Head shakes his fist.

Yeah, fly away, ya coward!

MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

The tortilla rips and disintegrates.

Uh-oh...

MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

In pieces, he drops off the ledge to the ground.

              95

Well, that’s just great!

MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

A section of tortilla props itself up, looks around.  It 
spots the classroom vegetable garden.  The eye goes wide.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT
Buzz is still trapped in the bin, banging on the ceiling.  
Hamm and Rex have grown weary of his calls for help. 

BUZZ
(muffled)

Help!  Prison riot!  

Give it up.  No one can hear you.

HAMM

BUZZ

(looking up, muffled)

What...?

I said no one can hear you!

HAMM

BUZZ

(confused, muffled)

What...?!!!

REX
(yelling)

He said, “No one can...!!!”

Shhhh...!!!  Will you be quiet?!

HAMM

He slaps a hand over Rex’s mouth.  A NOISE.  They look up.  
A ceiling tile opens.  Woody, Slinky, and Barbie drop in.

Woody!  You’re back!

REX 

Rex and Hamm move to the front of the bin.  Buzz runs to 
the back and jumps -- knocking Hamm and Rex off the bin.  
Buzz makes a break for it -- running across the floor.

Stop him!  Don’t let him get out!

WOODY

BUZZ

(into wrist radio)

Star Command, I’ve been taken hostage 
by my own prisoners!!! 

              96

Hamm and Rex tackle Buzz.  Hamm, Rex, Woody and Slink keep 
Buzz pinned down, as Barbie rushes over with the manual.

WOODY

Quick, open his back!  There’s a 
switch!  

They pull open Buzz’s compartment, revealing the switch.  
Woody flips it.  Buzz struggles. 

BUZZ

Unhand me, Zurg scum!  The Galactic 
courts will show you no mercy!

Woody flips the switch back and forth.

WOODY

It’s not working!  Why’s it not 
working?  Where’s the manual?

Hamm flips through at top speed.

HAMM

Here we go!  There should be a little 
hole under the Switch!

Little hole.  Got it!

WOODY

HAMM
(reading)
“To reset your Buzz Lightyear, insert 
paper clip....” 

Rex, use your finger!

WOODY

Oh!

REX

Rex sticks a finger in Buzz’s re-set hole.

Okay, now what?

WOODY 

HAMM 

All right, let’s see... “Caution: Do 
not hold button for more than five 
seconds.”

Abruptly, Buzz BEEPS loudly, falls limp, face plants.  
The others all look at Rex.  Rex lifts his finger. 

              97

REX 
It’s not my fault!

Suddenly, Buzz leaps up, knocking the Toys off him.  He 
strides forward, flips his wrist radio.

SPANISH BUZZ 

Bitácora Espacial -- Me he despertado 
de hipersueño en un planeta extraño.
(Star Log -- I’ve awakened from hyper-
sleep on a strange planet.)

The Toys are speechless.  Hamm glares at Rex.

Now what did you do?!

HAMM

I did what you told me...!

REX

Buzz -- hyper-alert -- glances sideways, narrows his eyes.

SPANISH BUZZ

Estoy rodeado por criaturas extrañas 
y desconozco sus intenciónes!!!
(I'm surrounded by alien creatures of 
unknown intent!!!)

He whips around -- flamboyant Latin-style -- and trains his 
laser on Woody’s forehead.

SPANISH BUZZ (CONT'D)

¿Quién anda ahí? ¿Amigo?  O Enemigo?
(Who goes there -- Friend?  Or foe?)

Uh...  Amigos!  We’re all amigos!

WOODY 

Satisfied, Buzz struts forward, greeting them.  

SPANISH BUZZ

Me debo haber estrellado, y se me 
borró la memoria. 
(I must have crash landed and had my 
memory erased.)

He approaches Woody, kisses both cheeks, strides off.

SPANISH BUZZ (CONT'D)

Han visto a mi nave espacial?
(Anyone seen my spaceship?)

We gotta switch him back!  

WOODY 

              98

SLINKY
How do we do that?
HAMM

(re: manual)

I dunno!  That part’s in Spanish!

Patrol Truck lights pass by under the hall door.  

We don’t have time for this!  C’mon!

WOODY

Woody grabs Buzz, hustles him toward the playground door.  

SPANISH BUZZ

Mi nave. ¿Lo encontraste? !Excelente!
(My spaceship?  You know where it is?  
Excellent!)

They pass the Lifer, watching from the shadows.

LIFER
Good luck, Cowboy.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
Jessie, Bullseye, and Mrs. Potato Head wait inside a 
concrete pipe.  Spotlights survey the playground. 

MRS. POTATO HEAD

(points)
Here they come!

Woody, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, and Barbie steal across the 
playground.  Spanish Buzz, trailing behind, does elaborate 
rear-guard defense poses.  Woody has to grab him and pull 
him along.  They duck into the pipe.

What took you so long?

JESSIE

WOODY

Things got complicated.  Where’s 
Potato Head?

JESSIE
We haven’t seen him!

Woody turns and peers out on the playground.  Buzz, the 
last to arrive, sees Jessie.  She turns to greet him.

Buzz...

JESSIE (CONT'D)

              99

Buzz is struck dumb.  Time slows.  His heart melts.  He 
approaches, drops to his knees, takes Jessie’s hand.

SPANISH BUZZ 

Mi florecita del desierto...!  Yo 
nunca he visto la belleza verdadera 
hasta esta noche!
(My desert flower...!  I have never 
seen true beauty til this night!)

Jessie is speechless.  She turns to the others.

Did you guys fix Buzz?

JESSIE

Eh...  Sort of.

HAMM

Jessie, behind you! Someone’s coming!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

The Toys turn.  A tall figure looms.  Mr. Cucumber Head 
steps into the light -- irked, agitated.
MR. POTATO HEAD

You would not believe...!  What I’ve 
been through...!  Tonight!

Mrs. Potato Head goes to him.

Darling...!  Are you okay?

MRS. POTATO HEAD

MR. POTATO HEAD

I feel fresh!  Healthy!  It’s 
terrible!

You’ve lost weight!  And so tall!

MRS. POTATO HEAD 

Bullseye nudges Potato Head’s torso toward him.  

MR. POTATO HEAD 

Ahhh, you’re a sight for detachable 
eyes!

He plucks his eyes out and plants them on the spud.

The Jungle Gym slide.  A Patrol Truck drives by.  Slinky 
slides down, pops out the bottom, looks both ways.    
At the top of the slide, Woody holds Slinky’s back end.  
The tail wags.

TIME CUT:

              100

Okay, all clear!

WOODY (CONT'D)

ON THE PLAYGROUND
The Toys shoot out the bottom of the slide, scamper off. 
They huddle behind the spring of an animal rocking swing. 

Almost there!

JESSIE

Jessie darts out, with others close behind.  The lights of 
a Patrol Truck approach.

WOODY
Back up, back up!

Woody backs into the shadows with Bullseye and the Aliens.  
The Truck pulls up and stops.
Jessie looks back, sees Woody and the others still hiding. 
Woody gestures “We’ll go around”.  Jessie does a thumbs-up.  
Woody and the Aliens ride Bullseye across the playground 
swing set.  They stop abruptly.  Big Baby is sitting on the 
last swing, CREAKING back and forth, gazing up at the moon.  
Bullseye and Woody tip-toe behind Big Baby, approach the 
wood siding for the swing set area.  Bullseye leaps over 
the siding but the last Alien falls to the ground.  SQUEAK.
Big Baby swivels his head 180 degrees.  
Woody, Bullseye, et al lie low behind the siding plank -- 
in the shadows, amid plastic shovels and buckets. 
Big Baby dismounts, walks toward their hiding place. 
Woody looks around desperately.
Big Baby reaches the wood siding, looks over.  
No one’s there.  Looks up and down.  He walks off.
HOLD ON an overturned plastic bucket.  Woody and Bullseye 
peek out from underneath, share a relieved look.
Jessie, watching from the bushes, sighs with relief.  
Abruptly, Spanish Buzz grabs her, yanks her to him.  As 
Jessie stands awkwardly, Spanish Buzz performs a solemn, 
impassioned courtship dance around her.
Finally, Spanish Buzz takes Jessie in his arms.  

              101

SPANISH BUZZ (CONT'D)
¡Ven conmigo! ¡Te mostraré las 
maravillas de la galaxia, y juntos 
lucharemos contra el despiadado Zurg!
(Come with me!  I will show you the 
wonders of the galaxy, and together 
we will fight the evil Zurg!)
He plucks a dandelion, offers it to her. 
At that moment, Woody pushes through the bushes -- safe.  
Jessie leaves Buzz, runs and gives Woody an impulsive hug.

Woody!  Thank goodness!

JESSIE

C’mon!  We’re almost there!

WOODY 

He and Jessie leads the Toys off, REVEALING Spanish Buzz -- 
stunned and heartbroken.  He throws down his dandelion.

El Vaquero...!!!

SPANISH BUZZ

Mad with jealousy, he narrows his eyes and runs after them.

EXT. TRASH CHUTE - NIGHT
Woody leads the Toys to the trash chute.  He jumps -- 
trying to grab the handle -- but can’t quite reach it.  

Buzz, c’mere, gimme a lift! 

WOODY

Buzz, smoldering, steps forward, dramatically pushes Woody 
aside.  With a lovelorn glance at Jessie, he hits a button.

SPANISH BUZZ
Buzz Lightyear al rescate!
(Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!)

Buzz steps to the chute, jumps up in a series of crazy, 
acrobatic moves, and grabs the handle, pulling it down.  

Abierto...!

SPANISH BUZZ

Way to go, Buzz!  C’mon, everyone! 

WOODY 

The Toys boost each other up onto the trash chute lid.  

              102

INT. GARBAGE CHUTE - NIGHT
Woody climbs in the chute with the others and peers down.  
POV -- The grimy metal chute recedes into blackness.   

Is it safe?

JESSIE

I guess I’ll find out...

WOODY

Woody begins a controlled slide down -- feet first, hand 
bracing.  He slips and it becomes an uncontrolled slide.  
He scrambles for traction, eases to a stop at the bottom.  
He gets up, stands at the edge of the slide’s precipice.
ANGLE -- An alley.  The trash chute cantilevers over a half-
closed dumpster.  Above him, stars twinkle -- freedom.

Woody...!  You okay?

JESSIE (O.S.)

WOODY

Come on down.  But not all at once.
MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)

What’d he say?

I think he said, “All at once”.

HAMM (O.S.)

NOISES.  

No...!  No!  No!  No!  No! 

WOODY 

Too late.  The Toys slide down together. 

TOYS
Whoa!  Watch out!
They collide with Woody.  Woody windmills his arms at the 
edge of the chute.  Jessie grabs him, pulls him to safety.  

Geronimo...!!!

REX

Thanks, Jess.

WOODY

Spanish Buzz looks about, confused and deeply disappointed.

SPANISH BUZZ

Donde esta mi nave...?!               
(Where’s my spaceship...?!)

Slink...?  Think you can make it?

WOODY

              103

SLINKY
I might be old, but I still got a 
spring in my step.

He backs up, then leaps over the open pit to the closed lid 
of the dumpster.  He lands hard, clutches a metal handle.  

He did it!

REX

All right, Slinky-kins!

HAMM

SLINKY
Okay!  Climb across!

Suddenly, two pink paws step in front of Slinky.  He looks 
up.  Lotso looms over him, grinning.  

You lost, li’l doggy...?

LOTSO

Lotso kicks Slinky’s paws.  He retracts, falling from the 
lid.  The Toys pull him to safety.  
Behind Lotso, his Gang hops off a wall and joins him on the 
dumpster lid.  Lotso notices Woody among the others.

Well, well...!  Look who’s back!

LOTSO (CONT'D)

A NOISE.  The Toys turn.  Lotso’s henchman -- Stretch, the 
Octopus -- clambers down the chute, blocking an escape.    
The Lifer Phone wheels into view -- wheels wobbling, one 
eye broken, frayed phone dangling.  His voice is hoarse.

LIFER

(via handset)

I’m sorry, Cowboy!  They broke me...!

Lotso turns to the Toys, as cheerful as ever.  

LOTSO 
(incredulous)

What are you doin’?!  Runnin’ back to 
your kid?  He don’ want you no more!

That’s a lie!

WOODY

LOTSO

Is it?  Tell me this, Sheriff -- if 
your kid loves you so much, why is he 
leavin’?

              104

CLOSE ON -- Woody, fuming.  He has no answer.  

LOTSO (CONT'D)

Y’think you’re special, Cowboy?  
You’re a piece of plastic!  You were 
made to be thrown away!

VROOM!  A garbage truck turns into the far end of the alley 
and RUMBLES toward them.  Lotso turns.
LOTSO (CONT'D)

(turns back)

Speak of the devil...!
Now we need toys in our Caterpillar 
Room.  And you need to avoid that 
truck.  Why don’t you come on back, 
join our family again? 

He smiles.  Woody seethes -- at a loss for words.  Jessie 
steps past him, eyes burning.  
JESSIE 

This isn’t a family, it’s a prison!  
You’re a liar and a bully and I’d 
rather rot in this dumpster than join 
any family of yours! 

Barbie steps forward.

BARBIE

Jessie’s right!  Authority should 
derive from the consent of the 
governed!  Not from the threat of 
force!

Hamm and Potato Head share a glance -- Huh?  Lotso grins.

If that’s what you want...!

LOTSO

He bangs his cane.  Stretch, the Octopus, begins to prod 
the Toys toward the precipice.  Abruptly, Ken bursts from 
the shadows -- still in his underwear.

Barbie!  Wait...!  

KEN

Everyone turns.  He runs to Lotso.

KEN (CONT'D)
Don’t do this, Lotso...!

LOTSO 

She’s a Barbie doll, Ken!  There’s a 
hundred million just like her!

              105

Not to me there’s not!

KEN

He glances at her.  She sighs.  Lotso picks up Ken.

Fine!  Why don’t you join her?!

LOTSO

He tosses Ken across the dumpster chasm.  The Toys grab 
him, pull him to safety.  Barbie hugs him. 

Oh, Ken!  

BARBIE

Ken stands and addresses Lotso’s Gang, earnest and heroic.

KEN 

Everyone!  Listen!  Sunnyside could 
be cool and groovy if we treated each 
other fair!  
It’s Lotso!  He’s made us into a 
pyramid and he put himself on top! 

(points)

Lotso’s Gang eyes each other.  There’s a shift in sympathy 
but no one wants to stick their neck out.  Lotso is amused.

Anyone concur with Ken?

LOTSO

No one moves.  The truck RUMBLES closer -- two dumpsters 
away.  Lotso turns to the Toys.  His face hardens.  

LOTSO (CONT'D)

I didn’t throw you away.  Your kid did.  
Ain’t one kid ever loved a toy, really!  
Chew on that when you’re at the dump!

He turns away.  Woody steps forward.

Wait...!  What about Daisy?

WOODY

Lotso keeps a steely composure.

LOTSO

I don’t know what you’re talking 
about.

WOODY

Daisy...? You used to do everything 
with her!

Yeah -- then she threw us out!

LOTSO

              106

WOODY
No -- she lost you!
LOTSO

She replaced us!

WOODY
(pointing)

She replaced you! And if you couldn’t 
have her, no one could!  You lied to 
Big Baby and you been lying ever since!

Woody yanks something from his holster.  It’s the rusty old 
pendant, “My Heart Belongs To: DAISY”.  Lotso is stunned.  

Where’d you get that...?!

LOTSO 

She loved you, Lotso...  

WOODY

She never loved me!  

LOTSO 

WOODY

...As much as any kid ever loved a 
toy!

Woody throws the pendant.  It lands at Big Baby’s feet. 
Big Baby stares, electrified, at the pendant -- a token of 
his long-lost love.  He picks it up.  His lip trembles.

Mama...!

BIG BABY

Lotso grabs the pendant.  He pokes Big Baby like a bully.

LOTSO 

What -- you want your Mommy back? She 
never loved you! Don’t be such a baby!

He throws it down and CRUSHES it with his cane.  Big Baby’s 
face crumples.  Lotso turns, yells at Stretch the Octopus.  

LOTSO (CONT'D)
Push ‘em in!  All of ‘em!  
This is what happens when you dummies 
try to think!

(to his Gang)

He shoves Big Baby.  Big Baby shrinks back, hurt.  
Stretch advances on Woody and the Toys.  They teeter at the 
edge of the precipice.  Lotso faces them, sneering.

              107

LOTSO (CONT'D)

We’re all just trash, waitin’ to be 
thrown away!  That’s all a toy is!

Abruptly, Lotso is lifted from behind by Big Baby.

Put me down!  What’re you doing?  

LOTSO (CONT'D)

Big Baby carries him to the edge of the dumpster.

Help me!  Help!

LOTSO (CONT'D)

Around the dumpster, no one moves.  Big Baby tosses Lotso 
into the dumpster.  He lands in the shadows, looks up.  
With a CREAK, the Big Baby tugs at the open dumpster lid.  

No...!  Wait...!

LOTSO (CONT'D)

KLOON!  Big Baby watches -- blank-eyed, pitiless -- as the 
lid SLAMS down, shutting Lotso in.  No one can believe it.   

He’s gone!!!

REX

Holy cow!!!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Ah-pppbbblllmmmmmmm...!!!

BIG BABY

He blows a RASPBERRY at Lotso.  VROOOM!  The Toys turn.  
The garbage truck is only 100 feet -- 15 seconds -- away.

C’mon!  Hurry!

WOODY

The Toys hop on the now-closed dumpster lid, rush to the 
retaining wall, and help each other clamber onto it.  
A SQUEAK.  Woody turns.  At the crack between the two lids 
are the three Aliens.  One Alien is stuck.  He struggles 
while the other two stand around ineffectually.  

WOODY (CONT'D)
Oh...!  For crying out loud!

Woody glances at the approaching truck, then runs back.

Woody...!

JESSIE

Woody yanks the Alien free.  Spanish Buzz gestures.

              108

SPANISH BUZZ

Vaquero, andale!  
(Cowboy, hurry!)

The Aliens retreat to safety.  Woody tries to follow, but a 
pink paw grabs his leg.  Woody tries to free himself, but 
the paw drags him slowly into the dumpster’s depths.  
The Toys watch, horrified, as Woody disappears. 
The truck turns and approaches the dumpster, fork out.

Oh, boy!  Incoming!

HAMM

BA-BOOM!  The truck’s forks slide into the dumpster and 
begin lifting it up.  As it rises past the retaining wall 
Jessie and Buzz fearlessly jump onto the rising dumpster.  

C’mon!

JESSIE

The other Toys follow.  Barbie tries to follow too, but Ken 
holds her back.

Barbie, no...!

KEN

They all try to lift the dumpster lid.  It won’t budge.  
The dumpster rises up, up, up -- and begins to tilt.
As the dumpster tilts, they start to lose their footing.  
As the dumpster nears vertical, the lid swings open and 
trash begins pouring into the truck.   Woody calls out...

Jess!

Woody!

WOODY

JESSIE

Woody falls into darkness.  A FLASH of pink goes by -- 
Lotso tumbles past.  The dumpster LURCHES to a stop.  
All the Toys fall into the truck.  
Barbie -- on the wall -- reaches forward.

No...!!!

BARBIE 

She turns away, burying her head in Ken’s comforting arms.

              109

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT
The Toys find themselves in darkness, awash in garbage.  

Can you hear me?! Is everyone okay?!!

WOODY

MR. POTATO HEAD 

Of course not, you imbecile!  We’re 
doomed!

Buzz pulls himself from a mound of garbage.  He GLOWS.  

Everyone!  Go to Buzz!  C’mon!!!

WOODY

The Toys begin wading toward Buzz.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT
The garbage truck rumbles through the streets.

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT
The Toys congregate around Buzz.  

We all here?  Slinky...?  Rex...?

WOODY

The truck lurches to a stop.   The hydraulic motor STARTS.  
Woody looks up.  A dumpster appears above them, tilting.

Against the wall, everybody!  Quick!

WOODY (CONT'D)

He leads the Toys to the front of the truck, seeking 
shelter.  Buzz remains behind.

SPANISH BUZZ

Senorita!  Senorita, donde estas...?!  
(Miss...!  Miss, where are you...?!)

Buzz...! 

JESSIE (O.S.)

He turns.  Somewhere in the DARKNESS, her voice rings out.  
A trickle of garbage begins to sprinkle down from above.

Senorita...!

SPANISH BUZZ

Buzz runs through the falling trash until he finds her 
pressed against the far wall -- terrified.  

              110

CLUMP!  Something large falls behind them.  They look up.  
Garbage is falling out of the dumpster directly above them.
Buzz takes Jessie’s hand and they run across the garbage 
truck bay, dodging madly while trash rains down upon them.
Against the back wall, the Toys watch, aghast.

They’ll never make it!

HAMM

Buzz grabs Jessie and carries her -- dodging and weaving.  
A SCRAPING sound above.  

Look out!

MRS. POTATO HEAD 

Buzz and Jessie look up.  An old TV set falls towards them.  
Buzz lunges and tosses Jessie out of the way.  She turns. 
CRASH!!!  The TV smashes down on Buzz.  A deluge of trash 
piles on top, burying him completely.

Buzz...!!!

JESSIE

As the dumpster above recedes, Jessie runs forward and 
begins digging.  The other Toys join her.  

Anyone see him?!

WOODY

Over here, y’all!  I found him!

SLINKY

They rush over and drag Buzz from the pile.  Buzz’s eyes 
are closed.  Jessie pops his shield, shakes him.

Buzz, you okay?!  Buzz!  Buzz!!!

JESSIE

No response.  Jessie shakes him again.  And again.  

No...!

JESSIE

She hugs him, sobbing.
A BEEP.  Buzz jack-knifes forward, then lurches back.  
Jessie pulls away.  Buzz sits up, eyes open -- disoriented. 
He sniffs the air with distaste.  Then he sees the others.
The Toys gape at him in open-mouthed wonder.  

              111

Buzz frowns.

That wasn’t me, was it?

BUZZ

JESSIE

Oh, Buzz!  You’re back!!!  You’re 
back, you’re back, you’re back!!!

She throws her arms around him, hugs him tight.   

BUZZ
Yes, I’m back!  
Where’ve I been?

(beat)

Beyond Infinity, Space Ranger!

WOODY

Woody!  

BUZZ

Woody smiles -- partners again.  Buzz looks around.

BUZZ (CONT'D)
But...  Where are we now?!

REX

(excitable)

In a garbage truck on the way to the 
dump!

Buzz’s smile freezes.

EXT. TRI-COUNTY DUMP - NIGHT
The garbage truck drives in the entrance.

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT
The truck grinds to a halt.  The BEEP-BEEP-BEEP backing-up 
alarm begins to sound.  The Toys look around.

Everyone -- stay together! 

WOODY

Everything lurches.  The truck bay begins to tilt.  

EXT. DUMP - NIGHT
The garbage truck tilts up -- higher and higher.  Trash 
begins pouring out the back, onto the dump below.

              112

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT
The back flap opens, allowing garbage to spill out.  A 
trash pit is revealed below.  The Toys begin sliding out.

Hold on!  We’re going in...!

WOODY

Whoa...!

TOYS

EXT. DUMP - NIGHT
The garbage truck extends fully, tilting 70 degrees.  The 
stream of garbage becomes a torrent.

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT
The Toys cling together, screaming, as they slide out into 
the open night.

EXT. GARBAGE PIT - NIGHT
Woody lands on a trash heap -- Oooff!  A plastic bag whips 
by.  He sits up.  He’s in a vast, wind-blown landfill.    
Nearby, Hamm and Rex unearth themselves.  Mr. Potato Head 
helps Mrs. Potato Head up.

You got all your pieces?

MR. POTATO HEAD

The Aliens pop up.  One points to some heavy machinery -- 
with a giant claw -- in the distance.

The Cla-a-a-aw!
They toddle off toward it. 

ALIEN

Hey!  Guys, no...!  No!!!

WOODY

Suddenly, the trio of Aliens is bathed in headlights.   
Before anyone can react, a bulldozer passes over them...   
Just like that, they’re gone.  

My Babies...!!!

MRS. POTATO HEAD 

A blinding LIGHT pours over her and envelops the Toys.

              113

Woody turns.  A bulldozer -- with giant, studded wheels and 
a massive grate -- is heading right at them.  Rex SCREAMS.
The Toys are pushed backward toward a trench.

Hang on!

WOODY (CONT'D)

They tumble as the bulldozer pushes them over the edge.

EXT. CONVEYER BELT - NIGHT
The Toys land on a conveyor belt entering a dark tunnel. 

INT. CONVEYER BELT - NIGHT
Woody sits up and watches the light receding behind them.  
The other Toys gather round.

Woody!  What do we do?

MRS. POTATO HEAD

We’ll be okay if we stay toge--...

WOODY

VWOOSH!  Slinky is pulled up OUT OF FRAME.

Slinky...!

Woody...!

WOODY (CONT'D)

SLINKY

Slinky is fixed to a fast-moving conveyor belt above them.  
Woody runs after him.

Slinky, get down from there!

WOODY 

A hammer shoots up and CLANKS on the belt, narrowly missing 
Slinky.   All around them, other pieces of metal begin 
FLYING UP and sticking to the ceiling belt.  Jessie yells.

It’s a magnet!  Watch out! 

JESSIE

High above, Slinky looks around.

SLINKY

Uh, you might wanna take a look at 
this!

The Toys scramble up a pile of debris.  

              114

Ahead is a Shredder -- two fast-spinning vertical cylinders 
that shred everything on the belt.  Buzz sees a lunch box 
near him starting to quiver....

Quick!  Grab something metal!

BUZZ

He grabs it and is pulled up to the magnetic belt.  Woody  
grabs a metal handle and flies up, sticking to the ceiling 
belt.  Hamm dives into a nearby pot and is lifted upwards.

You heard the guy...!

HAMM

Each Toy grabs a metal object and lifts -- CLUNK! -- to the 
ceiling.  Rex, the last, grabs an aluminum can, a CD, etc.

It’s not working!!!

REX

Finally, he grabs a metal fan and sails up to safety. 
Suddenly, a pink paw thrusts out from the belt below.

Help...!  Help me!!!  

LOTSO (O.S.)

Woody turns.  Lotso is pinned under a golf bag.

I’m stuck!  Help!!!  Please!  

LOTSO (CONT'D)

Woody looks at the approaching shredder.  He lets go.

Woody...!

JESSIE

Woody lands on the belt, runs back to Lotso. 

Thank you!

LOTSO

WOODY
Don’t thank me yet.

Woody struggles to lift the bag.  Buzz drops down next to 
Woody.  Jessie eyes the approaching shredder.

Buzz...!!!  Woody...?!!!

JESSIE 

Woody and Buzz push together.  They still can’t move it.  
Woody pulls out a golf club.  The magnet tugs it upward.  
Buzz grabs it.  Together, they pull it down and jam it 
under the bag for leverage.  The bag finally lifts... 

              115

Go!  Go!

WOODY

...and Lotso scrambles out.
Woody grabs Lotso.  He and Buzz point the club skyward.  
They’re pulled up to safety as the golf bag is pulverized.  
Lotso looks back at the shredder, then at Woody.

Thank you, Sheriff...!  

LOTSO

WOODY

We’re all in this together.
(turns)
Right guys...?

All the Toys have vanished. 

Guys?!

WOODY (CONT'D)

Woody! Down here!

JESSIE (O.S.)

Jessie and the others wave from a conveyer belt far below.  
Woody and Buzz let go and plummet.

EXT. DUMP / STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN - NIGHT
Woody, Buzz and Lotso land on the bed of a big, fast-moving 
conveyer belt with metal walls.  The Toys gather around.

Woody!

JESSIE

The toothed belt begins to ascend upwards.  

REX

Woody!  Look!  I can see daylight! 
We’re gonna be okay!

Rex points to a bright amber GLOW at the top of the belt.  
The toys scramble forward.  Woody’s smile drops.

I don’t think that’s daylight...

WOODY

FAST TRACK -- At the end of the conveyer belt, garbage 
falls into a burning, churning vortex. 
WOODY (CONT'D)

Run!!!

              116

Unable to jump off, the Toys begin running down the belt.  
They dodge, duck and hurdle over the coming trash, but 
they’re no match for the speed of the rising conveyor. 
Lotso trips, falls.  A pulsing blue LIGHT.  He looks up.  
High on the wall ahead is an Emergency Stop button.  A 
ladder leads to the button.  Lotso leaps up, grabs the 
bottom rung.  He can’t pull himself up.

Sheriff...!  The button!  Help me!

LOTSO

The Toys look back, see Lotso.  As they pass, Woody, Buzz 
and Jessie boost Lotso up.

Go!!!  Go!!!  Hit the button!

WOODY 

Lotso scrambles up the ladder toward the glowing button.
The Toys are carried up the conveyor belt toward the pit.  
The Toys watch Lotso -- receding -- as he climbs.
Lotso stays focussed on the button above him.
The Toys reach the belt’s acme -- heels at the edge of the 
waterfall of trash cascading to a melting, churning vortex.

Hurry!!!

WOODY (CONT'D)

Lotso reaches the walkway where the blue button glows.  He 
turns and looks -- malevolent -- at the helpless Toys.

Just push it!  Push it!

WOODY (CONT'D)

Push it!!!

BUZZ 

Lotso smirks, gives a salute.

Where’s your kid now, Sheriff?!

LOTSO 

He turns, runs off down the walkway.

No...  No...!  No...!!!

WOODY 

Lotso...!!!

BUZZ

              117

The Toys YELL as they tumble off the belt...

EXT. INCINERATOR HOPPER - NIGHT
The Toys land in a giant vortex of trash being sucked down 
into the glowing eye of an incinerator.  
It’s chaos -- trash tumbles over itself as sparks and ashes 
fly through the air.  The ROAR is overwhelming.
Woody stands and starts trying to climb out.  
The Toys do the same, climbing desperately, fighting 
against the trash tumbling into the vortex of fire.  
They slip, fall, get up and slip again.  It’s a nightmare -- 
no matter how fast they climb, they inexorably slide 
backwards.  Rex slides past Woody, towards the incinerator.

Ahhhhhh!

Rex!!!

REX

WOODY

Woody grabs Rex’s hand, slides further toward the inferno.  
They are all being pulled inescapably downward.
There’s no way out.  Jessie looks at Buzz.

Buzz...!  What do we do?

JESSIE

Buzz looks at her.  He reaches out, takes her hand.
Jessie grabs Bullseye’s hoof.  Slinky takes Hamm’s hand.  
Hamm reaches out to Rex.  The Potato Heads hold each other. 
Mr. Potato Head grabs Rex.  
Buzz reaches out to Woody... 
Woody takes Buzz’s hand, and the circle is complete.
As they approach the vortex, heat waves blast their faces.
The Toys close their eyes, turn away.  
Woody stares at the fire, shuts his eyes.  
This is the end.

              118

A LIGHT from above shines in Woody’s face.  
He opens his eyes.  
A giant mechanical Claw lowers towards them.  
The Claw plunges into the trash around them, closing them 
in its grip, then raises them up.
They soar into the air, away from the ROARING incinerator.  
Woody looks around in disbelief.  
The Claw spins, passing in front of the crane booth.

INT. CRANE OPERATOR’S BOOTH - NIGHT
In the booth, the Aliens man the joysticks.

The Clawwwww!!!

ALIENS

They lean into the joystick, steering the Claw to safety.

EXT. DUMP - DAWN
The Claw lowers and opens, dropping the Toys to earth. They 
spill out, COUGHING and GROANING like shipwreck survivors.
Woody sits up, looks around.  Rex pops up through trash.

Whew...!

REX

They have faced death and survived, and are profoundly 
shaken.  Potato Head stares at the sky.
MR. POTATO HEAD

Y’know all that bad stuff I said 
about Andy’s attic?  I take it all 
back.

SLINKY
You’re darn tootin’!

You said it!

HAMM

Buzz and Jessie sit up, still holding hands.  She looks at 
him, smiles.  He smiles and holds her gaze.  
Mrs. Potato Head takes Mr. Potato Head’s hand.

              119

Oh, darling!  You were so brave! 

MRS. POTATO HEAD

A SQUEAK.  The Potato Heads turn, see the Aliens approach.

You saved our lives...!  

MRS. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

And we...  Are eternally grateful!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Potato Head scoops them into his arms for a big, proud hug.

My boys...!

MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

Daaddddyyyy...!!!

ALIENS

Hamm looks around.

Hey!  Where’s that furball Lotso?

HAMM

I’d like to loosen his stitching!

SLINKY

Forget it, guys.  He’s not worth it.

WOODY

EXT. GARBAGE DUMP, ELSEWHERE - DAY
Lotso limps toward the dump exit.  A NOISE.  He turns, then 
drops, freezing.
A truck’s wheels SCREECH to a halt in front of Lotso.  A 
door OPENS and SHUTS.  FOOTSTEPS.  A hand picks him up.

Hey! 

Whatcha got?

GARBAGE MAN ONE (O.S.)

GARBAGE MAN TWO (O.S.)

GARBAGE MAN ONE (O.S.) 

I had me one a these when I was a 
kid!

He buries his nose in Lotso’s tummy, inhales.

GARBAGE MAN ONE (CONT'D)

(nostalgic rapture)

Strawberries...!

              120

EXT. GARBAGE DUMP - DAY
The truck exits the dump -- Lotso strapped to the grill.  
He comes to life, panicked.  On the grill are a couple of 
muddy, bug-spattered Plushies, including a sad-eyed FROG.  

FROG

Hey, buddy...!
...Y’might wanna keep yer mouth shut!

(Lotso turns)

The others SNICKER. Lotso WHIMPERS. The truck RUMBLES off.  
ANGLE -- The truck passes, REVEALING the Toys, unaware of 
Lotso’s karmic comeuppance.  Jessie sees Woody lagging.

C’mon, Woody -- we gotta get you home!

JESSIE

That’s right, “College Boy”! 

BUZZ

WOODY

But... What about you guys?  Maybe 
the attic’s not such a great idea.

He glances at them, uneasy.  Jessie steps to him.

We’re Andy’s Toys, Woody...

JESSIE

We’ll be there for him.  Together.

BUZZ

Woody smiles. 

I just hope he hasn’t left yet...

WOODY 

Wait a minute!  Wait, I’ll check!

MRS. POTATO HEAD

She covers her good eye, concentrates.

MRS. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

He’s still packing...!  
...But he’s almost done!

(GASPS)

He lives halfway across town...!  

HAMM

We’ll never get there in time!

REX

              121

The Toys glance at each other.  Then, distantly, comes the 
air-guitar WAILING of Andy’s Neighborhood Garbage Man.  
The Toys turn, see him a dozen yards away.  They brighten.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
Andy’s loading up his hatchback with boxes.  Molly’s on the 
lawn playing with Buster.  As the garbage truck passes...

C’mere, boy.  C’mon, Buster!

MOLLY

MOM

Is that it, honey?  You got 
everything?

ANDY

Yeah, just a few more boxes in my 
room.

At the curb, REVEAL the Toys hiding behind a garbage can.  
Woody peeks around, gestures to the other Toys.

Okay, c’mon!

WOODY

INT. BACK YARD - DAY
TIGHT ON SPIGOT -- Woody’s hand comes in, turns it.
The Toys huddle while Woody hoses them off.  Buzz closes 
his helmet.  The Toys react to the cold water.

Eeeaauggh...!!!  Brrr...!!!  Stop!!!

TOYS

HAMM

That’s enough, that’s enough, that’s 
enough!!

All right, go!  Go, go!

WOODY 

The Toys run off.  Potato Head pulls off his nose, blows 
out a spray of water.

EXT. GARAGE ROOF - DAY
Slinky heaves himself up to the edge of the garage roof.  
One by one, the Toys scurry up his Slink, then make their 
way along the roof towards Andy’s open window.

              122

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY
Buzz and Woody peer in.  

All clear...!

BUZZ

They clamber through the window, jump to the floor.  The 
other Toys follow, scrambling across the room.  
Mrs. Potato Head stops, puts a hand over her working eye.

TRANSITION:
POV -- Under the bed, looking out.  Mrs. Potato Head’s feet 
are in front of us, facing away.

There you are...! 

MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O.)

The feet turn and a hand reaches TOWARD US, GRABBING the 
subjective eye.

TRANSITION:
She pops her eye back in, blinks...  And GIGGLES, tickled.
The Toys climb into a box marked “Attic”.  Buzz helps them.
On the desk is a box marked “College”.  Woody heads for it.  
He reaches the box, turns.  This may be the last time he 
ever sees the other Toys.  He scrambles back toward Buzz.

Buzz...

WOODY

Buzz turns.  Woody offers a hand.  They shake.  

This isn’t good-bye.

WOODY (CONT'D)

Hey, Woody...

SLINKY (O.S.)

Woody looks up.  Slinky lowers a paw.

...Have fun at college!

SLINKY (CONT'D)

Yeah, but not too much fun!

HAMM

Woody laughs, shakes hands with Slinky. 

              123

Woody, take care of Andy.

REX

Yeah...

MRS. POTATO HEAD

MR. POTATO HEAD

He’s a good kid.  Tell him to get a 
haircut.

I will.
Woody sees Jessie.

WOODY

Jessie -- you’ll be okay in the attic?

WOODY (CONT'D)

JESSIE

‘Course I will.  Besides...  
...I know about Buzz’s “Spanish Mode”.

(leans in)

My what...?

BUZZ

He turns, confused.  Woody and Jessie share a smile. 

MOM (O.S.)

Honey, you want some food for the 
road?

I’ll get something on the way.

ANDY (O.S.)

Woody turns to Buzz -- there’s so much he wants to say.  
Buzz just smiles. 

You know where to find us, Cowboy.

BUZZ

Woody smiles.  He turns, runs to the desk.  
Buzz climbs in the Attic box with the others.  
On the desk, Woody jumps on the edge of the College box, 
looks back at his friends.  FOOTSTEPS climb the stairs.
Woody gives Buzz a salute.  Buzz smiles, salutes back.  
Woody lowers into the College box.  The Toys duck in the 
Attic box, pull the flaps shut just as Andy and Mom enter.  

Did you say goodbye to Molly?

MOM 

              124

ANDY

Mom, we’ve said goodbye like ten 
times!

Mom stops, suddenly overwhelmed.  The room is empty.

Oh, Andy...!

MOM 

Andy, beside her, is abashed.

Mom...!  It’s okay...

ANDY (O.C.)

IN THE COLLEGE BOX
Woody quietly peeks out the hand holes.
POV -- Woody can half-see Mom hug Andy.

MOM 

I know, it’s just...  I wish I could 
always be with you.
ANDY 
You will be, Mom.

ON WOODY 
He turns and glances off, noticing something.
THE PHOTO 
Of young Andy, playing with Woody and the other Toys.
TRACK IN ON 
Woody.  Mom and Andy’s words echo in his head. 
WOODY POV -- His GAZE SHIFTS from Andy-holding-Woody to 
Woody-with-the-other-Toys.
Suddenly, Woody half-smiles -- an epiphany.  Sadness and 
uncertainty are replaced by happiness and determination.
FOOTSTEPS and collar JINGLES approach.  Molly steps to the 
room’s threshold with Buster.

MOLLY (O.C.)

Hey...  Aren’t you gonna say goodbye 
to Buster?

Andy and Mom step into the hallway.

              125

ANDY (O.S.)

Of course I will...!
Who’s a good doggie?!  Who’s a good 
doggie?!!!  I’m gonna miss you!  

(to Buster)

While Andy scratches Buster’s belly, Woody jumps out of the 
box, grabs a pen and a sticky note.  He sneaks across the 
room, jumps on the Attic box, starts frantically writing.
Buster starts BARKING.  Woody finishes writing, looks up.

He’s telling you to go already.

MOLLY (O.C.)

C’mon, get the rest of your things.

MOM (O.C.)

Woody gasps, looks up at the door.
TRACK IN -- THE DOOR 
Andy walks in.  Mom and Molly stay in the hallway.

ANDY

Okay, Buster, don’t let Molly near my 
stuff.

Andy turns, crouches to pick up the Attic box.  
He stops, noticing the yellow Post-It on the box top.
He opens the flaps, finding all of his Toys.

Hey...!  

ANDY (CONT'D)

He digs through them -- pulling a few out, making sure 
they’re all there -- smiling with fondness and relief.  
He picks up the Post-It, reads it.  He calls out.

ANDY (CONT'D)

Hey, Mom...  So, you really think I 
should donate these?

Mom answers from the hallway.

MOM (O.S.)

It’s up to you, honey.  Whatever you 
want to do.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR - DAY 
Andy cruises, looking for an address.  A box with “Attic” 
crossed out sits in the passenger seat.  The car slows.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY
Andy grabs the box and gets out.
TRACK IN -- The hand slot of the College box, left behind.
POV - COLLEGE BOX -- Andy crosses the street and approaches 
the house.  
Andy stops, glances at the box.  On the Post-It is written: 

     DONATE TO:  
Bonnie 
1225 Sycamore Road

TILT UP -- The address on the front gate.  It matches.  
Andy sees Bonnie playing in the front yard, while her Mom 
and Dad garden nearby.

BONNIE 

No!  Don’t go in there!  The bakery 
is haunted...!!!
(another voice:)
Shhhhhh!!!  Are you crazy?!  You’ll 
wake up all the ghosts!

Andy watches Bonnie play -- exuberant and unself-conscious.  

BONNIE (CONT’D)
Look out!  The ghosts are throwing 
pies!  Splat!  Splat!  Splat!

Bonnie notices Andy and immediately stops playing.

Mom...?

BONNIE (CONT'D)

Bonnie’s Mom looks over, sees Andy.  She stands.

Andy...!  

Hi!

BONNIE’S MOM 

ANDY

Andy lets himself in the gate.  

              127

BONNIE’S MOM

Wow!  Look at you!  I hear you’re off 
to college?!

Yeah.  Right now, actually.  

ANDY

So, what can we do for you?
Bonnie goes and stands behind her Mom. 

BONNIE’S MOM

Uhh...  I have some toys here.

ANDY

Ohhh...!  You hear that, Bonnie?

BONNIE’S MOM

Bonnie peeks around her Mom, curious.

ANDY
So you’re Bonnie?

He hunches down so he’s eye to eye with her. 

ANDY (CONT'D)

I’m Andy.  Someone told me you’re 
really good with toys.  These are 
mine, but I’m going away now, so I 
need someone really special to play 
with them.  

Bonnie is uncertain.  Andy sits in front of her, cross-
legged.  He opens the box, pulls out Jessie and Bullseye.

ANDY (CONT'D)

This is Jessie -- the roughest, 
toughest cowgirl in the whole West.  
She loves critters, but none more’n 
her best pal, Bullseye.  
Yee-haw!  Here.

(whinnies; then, as Jessie)

Bonnie looks at her Mom, who nods. She walks forward. Andy 
gives Jessie and Bullseye to her. A smile escapes Bonnie.  
Andy pulls out Rex.

ANDY (CONT'D)

This is Rex -- the meanest, most 
terrifying dinosaur who ever lived.
“Raaawwwrrrrr...!!!”

(dinosaur voice)

He thrusts Rex at her.  Bonnie backs up, grins, takes him.  

              128

Andy pulls out the Potato Heads.

ANDY (CONT'D)

The Potato Heads -- Mister and 
Missus.  You gotta keep ‘em together 
‘cause they’re madly in love. 

Bonnie nods, takes them.  Andy pulls out Slinky and Hamm.

ANDY (CONT'D)

Now Slinky here is as loyal as any 
dog you could want.  But Hamm?  He’ll 
keep your money safe...

He drops a quarter into Hamm’s slot.

ANDY (CONT'D)

...but he’s also one of the most 
dastardly villains of all time...
“...Evil Dr. Pork Chop!”

(Hamm voice)

Bonnie smiles, takes them.  He pulls out the three Aliens.

ANDY (CONT'D)

These little dudes are from a 
strange, alien world -- Pizza Planet!

She smiles.  He hands them to her, then pulls out Buzz.

ANDY (CONT'D)

And this is Buzz Lightyear -- the 
coolest toy ever.  Look, he can fly... 
(deploys wings)
...And shoot lasers...
(fires laser)
He’s sworn to protect the galaxy from 
the evil Emperor Zurg!  

Andy hands over Buzz.  Bonnie presses a button on him.

“To Infinity...  And Beyond!!!”

BUZZ

Bonnie looks up, happily surrounded by Andy’s toys.  

ANDY

Now, you gotta promise to take good 
care of these guys.  They mean a lot 
to me.

Bonnie nods.  She glances in the box.  Her eyes go wide.

My cowboy!

BONNIE 

              129

Andy looks down, sees Woody lying in the box.

Woody...?  What’s he doing in there?  

ANDY 

He lifts Woody out.  Bonnie points.

“There’s a snake in my boot!”

BONNIE

Andy -- amazed -- pulls Woody’s pull-string.

WOODY
(voice-box)

“There’s a snake in my boot!”

Bonnie giggles and reaches for him, but Andy instinctively 
pulls Woody away.  Bonnie looks at Andy, confused.  
Andy looks down at Woody, makes a decision.  
He holds Woody out -- gentle and serious. 

ANDY 

Now, Woody -- he’s been my pal as 
long as I can remember.  He’s brave, 
like a cowboy should be.  And kind, 
and smart.  But the thing that makes 
Woody special?  Is he’ll never give 
up on you -- ever.  He’ll be there 
for you, no matter what.  Y’think you 
can take care of him for me?
Okay, then.

(she nods)

He hands Woody to Bonnie.  She hugs him.  
Andy suddenly grabs Hamm.

ANDY (CONT’D)

Oh, no!  Dr. Pork Chop’s attacking 
the haunted bakery!  Pchoo!  Pchoo! 

Without missing a beat, Bonnie joins in the play.

BONNIE
Oh, no!  The ghosts are getting away!
Woody’ll stop ‘em!!

She swoops Woody in the air.  Andy grabs Slinky and gives 
chase.  They EXIT FRAME, laughing.

Pchoo!  Pchoo!  Pchoo!

ANDY

EXT. BONNIE’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON - MONTAGE
Bonnie and Andy play together with all their Toys.

EXT. BONNIE’S HOUSE - DUSK
Andy walks to his car, turns.  Bonnie stands on the porch, 
the Toys scattered at her feet.  She clutches Woody. 
Bonnie makes Woody’s arm wave at Andy.  Andy smiles.
He gets in his car.  He takes one last look at all his Toys 
on Bonnie’s porch, and Woody in Bonnie’s arms...

Thanks, guys.

ANDY 

...And pulls away.

BONNIE 

Look, Mommy!  They’re all playing 
together!

Bonnie puts Woody down and runs to her mother’s arms.  

C’mon -- let’s get some lunch.

BONNIE’S MOM (O.C.) 

She scoops up Bonnie, swings her around.  Mother and 
daughter laugh as they step into the house.
On the porch, the Toys come to life, sit up.
Woody watches Andy drive away.
WOODY
So long, partner.

Buzz puts an arm around Woody.  
They watch Andy drive off.  
The other Toys gather around, and we...  
CRANE UP TO
...Blue sky, and fluffy clouds.

THE END
